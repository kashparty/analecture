Title: Induction over Numbers - 0
Category: 1 - Induction over Numbers

Welcome. This week, we will be discussing induction of our numbers.
0:03
We will start with a mathematical induction principally,
0:09
which will ease the fine for any property P and the property to be the property of the natural number.
0:11
So B is a subset of N. And this property is given.
0:17
We have seen it perhaps at school already or the first time.
0:25
There is no thinking involved. We work with a property. It's given to us not from that property.
0:29
We can then derive a mathematical induction principally for some specific property.
0:36
Cue, for instance, this property. You could be the sum of the numbers from zero until N is end times and plus one divided by two.
0:42
Or something else. This we can take the principle for any property and derive it for a property.
0:52
And we don't need to think anything would just do some systematic work.
1:01
Then out of this we can derive approved schema for the particular.
1:06
The proof schema will say things like given this in this, I need to show that in that or I take some think arbitrary was a natural number.
1:11
I assume something. I need to show something. This is where we set up the proof.
1:23
We don't yet go and do the proof. We have seen already that there are these two different phases when we're trying to prove things.
1:29
We saw that already last week when we were working with happiness and friendship and happy dragons.
1:37
And now then there's a lost last step where given the proof schema, we derive the proof and we put some thinking into feeling some of the steps.
1:44
So what we will be seeing this week is this whole process and we will be looking at
1:57
more and more interesting cases of induction of a numbers which will also be looking,
2:04
distinguishing between the numbers or order number, starting at the particular value or even the negative numbers.
