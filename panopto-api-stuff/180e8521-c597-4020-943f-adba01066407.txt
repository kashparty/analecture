Title: kgk - Introduction to Year 1 & Computing Practical 1
Category: COMP 1st Year General
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 07/10/2021
Welcome to the introduction to year one and to computing practical ones.
0:00
So let's start with the basics. Um.
0:06
Welcome to the department. I hope you like it here for the next three or four years, three plebeians,
0:13
four if you are and and maybe you will stick around later for a day if you want to see, but definitely make the best out of it.
0:19
My name is Constantinos. I briefly introduced myself before and KADEK at Imperial, so feel free to email me or find me on the team any time.
0:30
Your first year coordinator. So anything that has to do with your studies, like my three boys missing, I can't access this or that system.
0:40
Who do I contact about this or that? That's me, OK?
0:49
I'm not responsible for things like I lost my coursework, for example,
0:55
or I missed the training for people who actually go to college or I have some other reasons.
1:00
So the senior tutor is responsible for all of that.
1:07
You can just email them and for us are responsible for this role at the moment.
1:10
So if you have any meat Cirque's mitigating circumstances, he will speak with you and see what the appropriate route is.
1:16
If you inform us before the deadline may be if the circumstances are important enough,
1:25
we can give you an extension if inform us after our deadline, then needs a different process altogether.
1:33
Personally, if you care about this, I've used many computer languages, some of these include these ones, have you some other ones as well.
1:41
So you may find that Haskell and Codling are not my forte,
1:51
but it's fine because I'm employing about 100 Uta's and a few more days to help you with the lab and everything else.
1:56
So the details are the postgraduate teaching assistants and they will be your MMT tutors and lab helpers, MMD only for computing students.
2:06
The Uta's out on the grad. So year two, three or four students.
2:17
And basically they are your pity party tutors if they're here three or four or your lab helpers, including ear to these acronyms.
2:21
If you were wondering, it's personalised programming, small group tutorials, SCD.
2:31
This one is mathematics. Not really, but that's how they called it.
2:37
It's for discrete mathematics, logic, reasoning and graphs and algorithms.
2:41
And MMD is only for computing students. It's the maths method.
2:46
So that's how we used to call it. Now it's calculus.
2:50
And the other room, which is term to Petey's cover for 09 in terms one and two BMD cover for 18 times one and two and forward in time to Jameses,
2:54
you will find that four eighteen is also called for twelve for you.
3:09
That's just for logistical reasons because you skip the first part, which is discrete mathematics, because you do this on the maths side.
3:14
So you get to skip the first five weeks. Yeah, it's a good deal.
3:23
This is one for computing students. It's maths, so it's calculus in the first term and linear algebra and the second one.
3:29
So how to succeed in your first year?
3:37
Make sure you attend or watch all the lectures and read the lecture notes that provided so if not cover to cover at least all the important parts,
3:40
the parts that you didn't understand. Make sure you focus on them.
3:49
Attend the one hour tutorials you have. There's not JMT sorry, need to remove that.
3:53
You have three of them if you are a computer student or two of them if you are a maths student.
4:00
Last year there was something called JMT for my students, but not replace them with personal tutors, which is a better deal, to be honest.
4:07
So Petey's one hour a week,
4:16
BMT one hour a week plus an hour for MMD and they have exercises revise before attending any programming test or the exams in the summer time.
4:19
Make friends. That's very important. Join societies that always helps common interests or through group projects,
4:32
online activities, servers like these called WhatsApp, etc. helps inform the senior, etc.
4:41
If you are ill or are going to be absent before the deadline comes, that's going to help you going forward.
4:48
Don't wait until then. Wait until after deadline is too late at that point in form.
4:56
Again, I need to remove Tamati in four BBT p.m. the empty tutors of any tutorials are going to miss.
5:02
So you are expected to attend these tutorials and actually your absence is recorded.
5:08
So make sure you show up if you don't inform them in advance to be aware and ask for help if you need it.
5:15
If you can understand something, you can find something. That's what we're here for.
5:22
We're here to help you become the best you can be.
5:26
So, yeah. Oh, how to fail in your first year.
5:31
This is what not to do. Join many clubs in many societies and don't study and don't sleep.
5:36
That's the worst combination. Right. So don't do that.
5:45
Join a couple of societies, the one that interests you the most. Make friends, you know, participate in activities.
5:49
But don't overdo it. Party every night oversleep meets the early morning lectures and the other one and the other one.
5:56
So yeah, London is great and all even during the pandemic, many things are happening.
6:06
But, you know, be careful, stay safe, most importantly.
6:12
And if you do party, try to do it. When you have finished with everything else, you are a student.
6:16
You're also a human being. Of course, you need to enjoy and socialise and you need to find the balance between these two.
6:23
Again, study all the time and ignore your health and become too tired and bored.
6:32
You don't want to go to the other end either. Spend all your day studying.
6:38
You also need to look after yourself, your mental health, your physical health and socialise.
6:42
That's very important. Is that the truth and don't submit the exercises.
6:49
So these are there to help you to become better.
6:55
So even though the PPD and the penalties are not assessed so they don't actually count towards your final mark,
6:58
they are going to help you prepare for the things that are actually assessed for the coursework and the tests.
7:06
So make sure you do attend these, submit someone else's work as your own.
7:12
So that's called plagiarism. You'll be hearing a lot about this.
7:19
I'm going to post a link for a plagiarism awareness module on it on a system called Blackboard.
7:23
So I'm going to post that and you can attend it on your own time. So don't submit someone else's work.
7:31
Assume that just because you have the knowledge and the Panopto video that
7:38
everything is ready for you to download into your head like Neo in The Matrix,
7:42
if you watch that movie, is a new one coming out to make sure you catch up?
7:48
Yeah, that's not possible yet. We're getting there, but not yet.
7:53
So make sure we leave enough time to study, miss a lot of time doing other stuff like enjoying Holliday's or Hackathon or working for a company,
7:57
for example, even though you're building up your CV and enjoying your your life, which is great, it won't help you complete your studies.
8:10
And first and foremost, you are here to complete your studies.
8:18
So make sure you find the right balance.
8:21
Now, if you have specific mitigating circumstances, the senior tutor can have a meeting with you and that's fine.
8:24
But we can give you allowance for hackathon. For example, leave older students who say you don't need to study, just revise and that's it.
8:31
So I'm sure no one really believes that. But if they tell you that it's a lie, I don't believe that you do need to study.
8:41
You do need to manage your time and learn how to do it.
8:49
That's also part of the process. And it's a transferable skills that you can keep going forward.
8:53
And believe the myth from the schools that a level was the hardest thing you ever did.
8:59
Well, no, not university. And yeah, going forward, the university experience prepares you for everything else that's coming ahead.
9:05
Health and safety.
9:16
I always have to mention that you have to keep proper posture and take frequent breaks like 10 minutes every night, 90 minutes, more or less.
9:17
There are a couple of links here. I'm going to share the slides and science here and you can grab them and take a look.
9:26
Is these are owned by Citigroup and you can contact them if you're having technical issues,
9:33
they're happy to help and they have this space as well with more information.
9:40
Year one, it has eight core modules. Every module has coursework and exams and one special one, which is computing Peracha,
9:46
one, which is only coursework, but basically its tests and a group project.
9:54
If you're a student, you also get a Department of mathematics modules.
10:00
So you have less core modules from computing. It's two instead of eight.
10:05
Yeah. So it's a mixed experience from two departments. But usually during year one week, you have to attend lectures either online and offline,
10:11
you attend your pity party and maybe make tutorial, you submit some coursework, you submit the people to exercise the PMT exercise.
10:23
If you're computing MMT, you study or revise, you socialise and sleep.
10:33
Let's not forget that repeat. So that's usually what happens.
10:40
Um, of course, work is usually one or two exercises per module.
10:46
So if you have eight modules, expect up to 60.
10:52
I don't know. Depends really. So usually it's two.
10:58
Sometimes it's one for my module. Next academic year you have one.
11:02
Those prefer to. But yeah, make sure you factor this thing to your study time.
11:07
Programming tests are well it's five plus one.
11:14
It's two for high school, two for Java and one for C plus a group project.
11:20
So it's six things in total and your exams begin at the summer time.
11:26
So you have your all your exams for all your module from both terms in the summertime.
11:33
OK, now let me just look at the chart in case I'm missing an important question.
11:40
Mm hmm. O kay.
11:47
No, that's pretty quiet. Anything you would like to ask me at this point, or should I just go on?
11:55
Yes, there's a raised hands, please go ahead, Gabriel, who do we know who are senior tutor?
12:04
There is only one senior tutor for the entire department as far as the undergrads are concerned.
12:13
And that's Firas, who you briefly met on the introductory video and in the well, first session afterwards, if you don't remember his name,
12:18
just if you go to Outlook and start typing Doch senior tutor, read all the complaints so you can get the email.
12:27
OK, thank you. And just type. Don't think that's the one.
12:35
Is this being recorded? Yes, it is. Of course I try to record everything if that's possible.
12:42
So this is going to show up on your Panopto afterwards. OK, let's go along.
12:48
So four or nine has turned one high school weeks, one to six.
12:56
So you're not in week one and week six.
13:01
That's when high school ends and you have like an assessment to see how far you've achieved so far by that point.
13:04
So it's like it's the first test programming test.
13:13
It's the high school interim test. And it doesn't count by a lot.
13:17
It's like five percent. So it's really tough to get you started with tests and then has stops at the end and you get codling weeks,
13:21
seven to ten, OK, and you have something else called professional.
13:32
It's useless ethics, which is on week 11.
13:38
It's the entire week, basically time to start before you even start.
13:41
You have the final test for high school, and that's the one that really counts.
13:47
And then you have Java starting immediately after that.
13:51
And then one day and you have to test again the deadline and the Java final.
13:55
So you get both of them. There's no break in between what there is the Easter break, but no other language.
14:02
And then term three arrives. You have exams and then get C, we don't have any PBT session to support it.
14:08
But by that point, you'll be experts in three languages already.
14:15
So C is the mother of all languages, so you should be fine.
14:19
And you have a group project and a test overall.
14:23
As far as foreign aid is concerned, high school is worth 30 percent top 40 and C is 20.
14:28
And if you do the maths, you will find that 10 percent is missing and that's professional is useless ethics.
14:36
So this is really important. Some students say, I don't care about this.
14:43
I can't be bothered to write the report or do the presentation.
14:48
And yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
14:52
Maybe you did this many times at school and you feel like now you're just going to focus on coding and stuff.
14:55
But that's not how it works in the real world. You need to present your work multiple times.
15:02
You need to know and be ethical about it. You need to know what the implications are involved in your project.
15:07
So professional issues and ethics is going to help you with that,
15:14
help you prepare for carrying out proper projects like the upcoming thirty year group project and the final year project,
15:18
which you will need to research by yourselves.
15:26
So that's 10 percent that it's worth can save you in the end, since Camp for nine has a 50 percent pass mark, everything else is at the forty percent.
15:28
That's bottom line. Is that fifty percent. So how do I find all of this course?
15:43
Well, you need to go to Kate, which is our own valley, and then you will find the coursework there.
15:51
Everything for four nine is there. I just need to move for one test.
15:56
The high school test needs to move back, but I will fix that tonight. And yeah, everything can be clicked on to receive this back.
16:01
And then you submit your work there for normal coursework if it's a programming coursework.
16:09
There's a different process, which I will explain briefly. Make sure you submit before the deadline.
16:15
If you submit at the last possible minute if something goes wrong, like, say, you have some sort of lack of latency, then you may get capped.
16:22
Copied meaning means that you will be capped at the pass mark of the module.
16:32
You can't get more than 40 percent or 50 percent depending on the pass mark.
16:37
So if you submit one second late for PBT, let's say you get captivities percent and I mean, you don't care because it's it doesn't count to the end.
16:42
Right. Well, OK.
16:53
But for actual coursework exercises that do count, you will be capped at 40 percent and you won't get more than that even if you achieved 95 or 100.
16:54
Right. So make sure you don't have maybe even a second late in the programme.
17:06
And labs are released every Monday at nine and the deadline is Friday at seven.
17:12
It's like a job you get first thing on Monday and you submitted last thing on Friday the opportunity to meet with you over the week.
17:17
They will have marked the previous weeks exercise. They will have some feedback for you.
17:26
You can discuss other things as well. And then the week after that, you will discuss the next week exercise and so on and so forth.
17:30
So they're not there to teach you new things. They're there to help you revise or recap existing knowledge.
17:37
Now, all the labs, all the exercises, they last one week, except for the first exercise, which is coming out today.
17:44
Right after this session, I'm going to be releasing sequences,
17:53
which is a very simple one day exercise meant to introduce you to the lab and teach you how to submit it.
17:58
After this lecture ends at five in forty minutes, it will be released on Kate and you will have access to your report shortly after that.
18:05
Deadline is tomorrow at seven. So don't miss don't miss the lab session tomorrow as a lab session from two to four.
18:16
We're trying to make this lab session hybrid, which means that even though I have like forty something helpers,
18:24
some of them will be online on teams and some others will be on campus.
18:32
So if you're on campus, potentially, if I have enough helpers around there, you can just raise your hand and someone will come and help you.
18:36
But please maintain a distance. It's not very straightforward right now.
18:44
You still need to make sure you're safe. So if you really need to get hands on and set your mouse or whatever,
18:49
it's probably better if you ask online for help with screen sharing, which is electronic and that's safe.
18:57
Any questions that. Yeah, so the first high school test will be on week six, that's going to be fixed on Cape soon.
19:05
And do these test carry specific weights? Yeah. So high school, for example, has to test.
19:14
The first one is five percent. The second one is twenty five.
19:20
For normal modules, you have that 20 percent for the coursework and a 15 percent, 15 percent for the coursework.
19:26
And when you're 85 for the 85, I think it's.
19:35
Yeah, it's on the website. Let me just post a link. It's faster that way instead of me trying to remember the numbers.
19:40
There we go. So everything you want to know is here.
19:48
Yeah. Cool, um.
19:54
Mm hmm. Are there any assignments due for tomorrow?
19:58
Yes, there is one that's going to be released after this session. Do we need to book for tomorrow?
20:03
Well, we have already booked specific rooms for you from two to four.
20:09
So you don't have to use office space for that specific time.
20:15
If you want to stay before or after there's a link or an office space that I can provide that you can use to to book.
20:19
Let me find the link for you, which is this one space.
20:29
OK, so here's the office space link, as promised.
20:37
OK. Uh, on the questions. Do the labs carry any weight so the labs, the PPTA exercises are on a.
20:42
Well, they are not weighted, but they are marked.
20:53
So you will receive a mark in just one count towards your total.
20:57
The mark is just there as a feedback, so to speak.
21:01
Uh. Where exactly is the homework?
21:06
Well, the coursework can be found on get under the specific modules.
21:10
If you find four or nine, you can see there's like an exercise called sequences.
21:15
You click on its name, you get a spec, but it's going to be enabled at five.
21:20
Do we need to download some software to upload our work? Not really.
21:26
You will. You will need it. Yeah, but that's not I guess you need to to to download it, I suppose, depending on your system.
21:31
So if you don't have Linux, you may need to install a Linux subsystem.
21:44
I will explain this later. Can you show us how to do the assignment to Kate so you just click on Kate Plus you're here, see one or do one?
21:50
It's described that document that she has sent you before you arrived.
22:01
And then in there, you will find everything which rooms are available for tomorrow.
22:06
It turns out that it's many, many rooms to 19 to six to to to ten, I think.
22:12
And then the two rooms next to it. Yeah. So text Hellcat for their own numbers.
22:19
I was required to submit working with those systems. It's not assessed and it's not marked.
22:25
That's just for fun. So you don't have to submit it.
22:31
But yeah, you're welcome to know it's going to actually take that one.
22:35
We're only going to check the hostile sequences. One, um, how to find things on Panopto.
22:40
Well, ideally, the Panopto videos are linked on science here.
22:48
By your lectures, we could just click on here and it takes you to the Panopto video.
22:52
If you can't find it there, then just gone Panopto click on the browser on the left side,
22:58
find on the list, find the module that you're after four of nine, for example.
23:03
Click on that. You'll find the videos in there. If we go in the lab in person, do we need to book a space?
23:08
No, because we have a book. Everything, all the rooms for you from two to four tomorrow.
23:15
There's nothing to click on. Has consequences until five o'clock, at which point it will become clickable.
23:22
Yes. OK, let's move on a few nice names here.
23:29
Let's go through them. So science is where you find all the notes for your modules and a few other resources,
23:37
like links for Panopto videos and science katis where you find your coursework and the deadlines.
23:43
If you look at the coursework that have been entered there, you can click on them once they become enabled and you can get this back.
23:49
And then for normal coursework, there's a pattern where you submit for programming coursework.
23:59
You go over laptops, which I'm going to cover now. Get lab is like GitHub.
24:04
If you know it's like a git repository. It's a place on the cloud where you can store your code and it has versioning.
24:09
So every time you overwrite the previous version, it keeps the older ones.
24:16
If you make a mistake, you can roll back to our version that actually worked.
24:21
It's really helpful. Docs has released a few guides on this already.
24:25
You can find the links on science. Yeah, and we'll be covering this again in time three for your group project.
24:30
But a bit more advanced to Geek Lab is the one we're using here.
24:39
The department, it's free for you. You have Reppas created there for you for these exercises.
24:43
You just need to access them, clone them locally, you know, do stuff, change them, and then you post the code back onto the cloud.
24:50
Everytime you saying something in your code, it's best if you commit and you posted saying this as we say.
25:00
So it's like save and store.
25:07
So comment is a message to try to explain what you did and push is when you actually send you upload the code back to the lab.
25:10
So it's stored on our servers. Even if you move to a different computer or if you lose all your work touch, all this will never happen.
25:18
But even if you lost everything, you still have it. Don't give up on our servers.
25:25
OK, so it's very important for you to do that in any way.
25:30
You need to do that because that's how you submit your code to us.
25:34
This is a system we have built internally in the department, and it's meant to test your code, so every time you post a new version of your code,
25:39
you can go on laptops and you can click on the exercise work you're working on like sequences, for example.
25:49
And then in there you will find the latest version of your code. And it has a button that says test.
25:55
You press it and it tells you how many of the tests you're passing, the more test you're passing than more, you know, correct.
26:01
Your code is ideal. So once you test enough versions of your code, hopefully at some point you will have a version that's passing all the tests.
26:09
So that's the one you should submit. Ideally, if you don't have enough time to submit the latest version of your code, that's also fine.
26:20
The tests are provided for you as part of the skeleton code we give you so we don't ask you to start from scratch.
26:29
We give you some code and then we'll tell you like write your code here or there, whatever is missing.
26:36
You can also run these tests locally before you actually push and use laptops.
26:43
And you can add your own tests. You can submit your own test. That's also fine.
26:49
Yeah. When you're happy with everything to submit your code, you don't have to go to court directly.
26:52
You just press a button on laptops that says submit to Kate and laptops, submit your code for you to Kate.
27:00
And how do you know they submitted it turns green and it takes you to Kate.
27:08
And in there you will find that it has submitted a key.
27:13
There's a very long number and that key should match the one you have submitted from lab tests.
27:17
Some people are asking, when it takes me to Kate, it asks me to sign something.
27:24
So that signature that says your work is your own. It's pre signed for you by laptops, for individual projects.
27:29
When we reach the summer term and you have to submit a group project, that's when you need to actually sign that thing with your group members.
27:38
But let's leave that for the summer time for now.
27:46
Once you press the button and it turns green, you have submitted to Kate and Kate will accept many, many submissions until the deadline.
27:49
You can submit every single version to Kate. You don't have to wait until the end.
28:00
Right. You can submit one now, then replace it with another one and replace it with another one until the deadline.
28:05
It will stop submitting after a deadline because if you submit after the deadline, you will be capped.
28:11
So lobbyist doesn't let you get capped. OK, make sure you have something submitted before the deadline.
28:17
So that's a declaration.
28:27
So this has been signed for you by updates on Kate and basically it says, I wrote this code, it's my own right if it's not your own.
28:28
And we find that that's a plagiarism offence. And you will be speaking with Thomas, the senior tutor, and, yeah, depending on how serious it is.
28:39
Let's let's not worry about that now, but just don't do it, OK?
28:52
There's also another system called e-marketing.
28:59
That's where you will receive your feedback from your pity party and probably from other coursework as well.
29:02
You don't have to upload anything to it. Everything's uploaded there for you.
29:08
You just need to download your marking from the system once this is submitted.
29:12
So when you go Utya submits the mark to work, they will do so on this system.
29:17
You just go there, click on the exercise and retrieve your marked work.
29:23
It should have some comments on the PDF with written text or a mark, an actual mark.
29:27
Let me check the tags, see what we're after here. Mm hmm.
29:34
Mm hmm. So you're going to see all your previous great so Kate, when you enter Kate, it has like a personal profile button.
29:38
If you click there, you can find all your marks there. Can I put any programming projects I complete on my gift hub?
29:47
Well, you can add your code on GitHub, but you because it's the solution to an exercise that we wrote in,
29:56
because Imperial owns the copyright and intellectual property of the exercise itself, you can't actually make it public.
30:05
So even though you can add your code to GitHub, you have to make it a private repository.
30:13
And if an employer wants access to it, you can give them access. That's fine,
30:18
but don't make it public because then you're basically sharing a solution to one
30:23
of our exercises with the world so anyone can just search for it and find it.
30:27
And that's not allowed. So if we find that you're sharing a solution publicly, we email you and we take it down.
30:33
But it will save us a lot of time if you don't do it, especially if you're a current student.
30:40
Right. So don't do it only on private drippers. How do you actually love this, so you type that address,
30:46
the link will be available in my PowerPoint, but yes, thank you for adding the link in the chart.
30:56
Um, when we have three hour periods of back to back lectures, how do we take frequent breaks?
31:03
Well, that's the benefit of standing on line. Right. And you can just leave the computer playing, running and you just move around to stretch.
31:11
No one's going to be looking at you if you turn your camera off like I am.
31:23
So if you were in a classroom and you started stretching and getting up and jumping around, maybe it would be a bit distracting.
31:29
But if you're starting from home, that's the benefit of doing that in real world lectures on the last 15 minutes,
31:38
they start zero zero and then that 50 and then you have ten minutes left for whatever else you want.
31:46
So ideally, you would never have a back to back lectures and everything should have a ten minute break.
31:54
I know that some lectures sometimes may last the entire hour, but this is not the norm.
31:59
And your your representatives, when you vote for them, should make sure that this message is clearly communicated to the lecturers.
32:06
Every session is 15 minutes long, not 60. Cool.
32:14
Thanks, Amy, for suggesting yoga. Do we get lower scores from multiple submissions?
32:21
No, because you only submit the latest one, only the final one is something that we've done.
32:26
We never see the previous submissions. We only see the last one will today maths course be uploaded to marking.
32:31
So today we had a test for the MMD. So Jamesy students do not have to worry about that.
32:40
Yes, these scores are going to be uploaded somewhere. Somehow I'm going to figure out where that hopefully is going to be on marking.
32:47
Yes, hopefully I'll figure this out. If not, I mean, this is a special kind.
32:55
It's a diagnostic one. So we'll see. Otherwise, someone's going to email you to actually it lobbyist linked to your lab.
33:01
Yes, it is love. This is linked to your lab report. Yeah.
33:08
When will in-person lectures start taking a shortcut?
33:13
If court has room numbers, it means you can go there.
33:17
If it doesn't have room numbers, it means you can't go there.
33:22
We're trying to make this run live as soon as possible, but it's two hundred and thirty of you, so we will need to spread you over multiple rooms.
33:25
It's not very easy to do that. So we're working on that.
33:34
But office space is on line. If you start if you want to book some office space, some lab space.
33:38
Cool. This op ed them it's a forum, it's a single forum for every module,
33:45
you go there to ask questions and other classmates or lecturers may respond and help you.
33:53
I noticed you happen to be using it a lot, but please do use it.
33:59
It's very important and very useful. And you don't have to wait for the next lab session.
34:03
Just post your question there and someone will know the answer and help you out if you do help someone out.
34:08
Please don't give them your solution. That's not helping them.
34:15
You want them to, you know, to get to the solution by themselves.
34:18
So guide them there, give them some suggestions. Don't actually copy paste the answer you have found.
34:23
These were your videos, your recording stored everything is separated by module folders.
34:32
Hopefully everything is recorded. If you forget to press the record button, please remind us and everything should be uploaded there afterwards.
34:40
However, it's not supposed to replace your module.
34:47
Attendance is just the companion. OK, so actually attend the live session and ask your questions there.
34:51
Don't just wait for the recording hoping that your questions have been asked by someone else.
34:58
And finally, Microsoft teams or Zoom. So we are here right now.
35:05
It's the platform we're using for these EA sessions. Maybe next year will have more physical sessions.
35:09
We'll see. But right now we are online. Last year was entirely online.
35:16
So I'm calling this progress now that we can go hybrid for a few things.
35:21
Many students are already using the labs to work from there.
35:25
So whatever helps you focus and study, that's great.
35:29
The library also has a physical presence, so that's great.
35:33
Yes, now, before nine labs take place on teams every Monday, four to six and Tuesday and Friday,
35:38
two to four, that's after next week, right this week, it's a different than any other week.
35:46
So as of next week, Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays for week one only, we have a single channel that we want to know.
35:52
And then you go in there and you ask your questions.
36:02
After week one, every teaching assistant will get their own channel and it does go knock on their door.
36:05
Well, it's not a real door, but you enter your channel, you thank them and you say, can you help me with this?
36:11
And then they start the meeting with you in the channel and you get help and you end the meeting and you move on.
36:17
You may have noticed an extra tab on the general channel that we are here now on teams.
36:25
It says right here to do so. This time takes you do this form that you can use to rate your teaching assistants experience.
36:31
So if you had a good experience or a mediocre one or not so good one,
36:40
please feel free to use this form and submit your experience and can use this information to improve whatever I can improve from my end.
36:45
So I appreciate that. OK, if you're wondering how you can identify to who are available, their channel will have a camera if they're busy,
36:54
which means they're in a call in tunnel, doesn't have a camera, they are free.
37:05
Just thank them and you will catch their attention.
37:09
There are many other things, but this is a recap of everything you should know too much already,
37:15
but, you know, I will upload this material on Scientia.
37:20
The video will also be available on Panopto. Just go step by step and you'll get there.
37:25
The lapsation tomorrow can help you. And we have like 40 Uta's an hour.
37:31
Amazing to me will be there as well. So please show up either online or on site and try to get some help if you show up on site.
37:37
Please note that the space is limited, but we have many rooms booked, so hopefully you will find some space and you can bring your own device.
37:49
We have Wi-Fi frequently asked questions.
37:58
Well, before we go there, let me look at the chart. Scroll, scroll, scroll.
38:02
And. When can we expect to be switched to 50 minute lectures yesterday?
38:08
But, yeah, as I said, just.
38:17
If this is happening all the time, ask your representatives to remind the lecturer that it shouldn't be happening.
38:22
Are all lecture notes on science here? Yes, they are.
38:31
Or they're going to be uploaded shortly. So either ideally before the lecture or immediately after the lecture, such as the in the case today.
38:34
I'm going to upload it now. Yeah. Do we need to Google up space for tomorrow if it's already booked on SALEKHARD,
38:43
if it has a room number and so it means we have booked the entire space for you.
38:50
Now you may go there and you'll find that someone else from a different year is sitting in a space that you wanted to use.
38:55
If you can't find any other space, you can politely ask them to step away for a couple of hours and then return once their time is back.
39:03
But yeah, you you have ownership of those spaces for that time.
39:12
Oh, yes. They will be on site tomorrow as well. Thank you for that.
39:20
The first task your lab will show on Kate at five and the three boys will be created a few minutes after five.
39:24
Yes. Frequently asked questions, I want to use Linux, but they only have Windows,
39:34
you can download a virtual machine, for example, a virtual box or VM player install it.
39:43
It's like an application, like a programme on your Windows machine.
39:48
And then inside that virtual machine, you install an operating system like one to Linux, for example.
39:53
So you have Linux running inside your Windows instead of reporting your entire machine into a different operating system.
40:00
And whatever you're doing there, even if you break something, you don't have to worry about it because it's isolated.
40:09
So your Windows system will not be affected by Linux.
40:16
But I have a Mac. OK, well, Mac is based on Unix.
40:21
So you already have something like Linux. You have like a terminal and tools you can install and that's great.
40:24
But sometimes things don't work as you expect them.
40:31
So even if you're a Mac user, you can benefit from installing a virtual machine.
40:35
Like I think there's virtual box for Mac, but there's also parallels and there's definitely a VMware format,
40:39
something so a virtual machine, install Ubuntu on it. And then you have the same experience as if you were sitting on a love machine.
40:46
So I have this thing and I cannot miss it. And it's on deadline day will either submit before that thing or speak with a senior tutor.
40:55
If it's a valid excuse, a valid reason, we can make some extensions for you can make some adjustments.
41:04
But if it's just, you know, an interview or a hackathon, we can really help with that to submit before deadline.
41:11
I prefer to work alone. Why should I attend the lab? Yeah, I get that every year.
41:20
So interacting with others is quite important and exchanging ideas, not physical actual code,
41:25
but ideas and discussing with the helpers is helping you not just socialise, but also practise your skills and brainstorm.
41:32
So that's what the lab is about. It's not just to help you find the answer or an answer, a correct answer.
41:41
It's also there to help you meet other people for group projects or to collaborate in the future or just to enjoy.
41:47
But I hate working with others. Well, this world has achieved everything it has achieved because of all the people working together.
41:57
If it was everyone by themselves, we wouldn't have reached this this height of development that we are right now.
42:06
So at some point in your lives, you have to be part of a group or a team and we ask you to do so very soon.
42:15
You have a group project coming up with 11 of this term and another one in the summertime.
42:22
So, yeah, please try to think about socialising as much as you can.
42:29
Now, let me see. That s for one last time.
42:38
Two, if I have issues with installing Linux, who do I ask it says come to the labs tomorrow online or on site and someone will help you there.
42:43
OK. Question Time, I hope you're on the Internet.
42:53
Just go to menti dot com and type of this code.
42:59
If you scan these QR code, you can also get to the same page.
43:03
There's a question there for you to answer. So I'll just leave this slide on for a minute.
43:09
Dun dun, dun, dun dun, I mean, look at the chart in the meantime, I know I know, Jamie, this this was supposed to be a joke.
43:18
I used to have this slide on the on the physical lecture.
43:29
And then last year I left it in as a joke and people laughed.
43:34
So, yeah, I said, why not?
43:39
And you would be surprised some people I have found two people so far who didn't have a smartphone with Internet access, and that's that's great.
43:42
I mean, I used to be one of them until a few years ago, but, yeah, smartphones, you know.
43:54
So let me look at the results. So we have 110, 115, it's how many of you are out there, it's 200 of you.
44:05
Wow. Welcome, everyone. So let's see, can we get to 200?
44:18
Can we do this? Kim Dotcom, and that's the code like you are, is also there are the.
44:24
140. OK, so that's that's reasonable.
44:39
So one hundred and thirty people have said, yes,
44:44
I understand the features and I look forward to it and about 20 of you said I'm a bit lost and that's fine.
44:48
That's completely understood. That's why we're doing these things.
44:56
And that's why tomorrow we have a lap session and more than 40 of our teaching assistants will be there.
45:00
So please do come online or on site and ask any questions you want to as long as you know there are curriculum related.
45:08
So if you have any further questions that I haven't addressed today,
45:16
you can post on on Edstrom and on them and someone will answer or if it's very specific, just email me directly.
45:20
To summarise for 09 is where you find Haskell called insolvency exercises and tests.
45:30
Kate is where you can download your coursework specs from and that's where you submit your code.
45:38
But to submit this programming code, you go via GitHub.
45:44
So you push it together, then you test it on laptops and then you press a button and laptops to submit to Kate.
45:48
Whatever you do, submit before the deadline, way before deadline and produce your own original work.
45:56
OK, if you have further questions, find me tomorrow in the labs or email me directly or post on at them and just enjoy your time here.
46:04
I think we will make the best of it, make friends, have fun and yeah, at some point I will see you in person.
46:13
Until then, where is it. I have a button.
46:22
Thank you, everyone. Take care. Bye bye. Thank you.
46:25
