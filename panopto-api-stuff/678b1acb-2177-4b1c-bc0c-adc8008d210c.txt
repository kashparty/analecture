Title: Sequences III (Live Recording 20/10/2021)
Category: COMP40016 - Calculus (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Paul Bilokon
Date: 21/10/2021
Let's look at, for example, this sequence. Let's take yeah, let's take what we're going to take and we're going to take this equals.
0:19
And I did back then and can range from one to 10 questions, and I need not a poor sign, so let me make sure that number is imported.
0:57
So let's make sure enough is imported and we let's put this.
1:23
Well, that's not really enough to tell much about the sequence, so maybe I should take this as a 100.
1:36
So let's look at what the sequence looks like. So does it look like the sequence converges?
1:44
Yes. To what limit? Zero zero.
1:53
And what do you think, which sequences could we use to bound this sequence?
2:04
Which sequences could we use? So we need to sandwiched between two sequences, one over and negative one.
2:14
OK, let's try that. Let's let's plot one or end.
2:22
And let's out the negative one over and.
2:37
Yep, this looks like there some it maybe I do this.
3:05
Yeah, that looks that looks promising. So that looks promising.
3:15
Yep, thank you. Yes, there is a raised hand heckling high for sandwich theory for the bounding curves, not consequences.
3:27
Do we have to show that the pounding sequences are strictly strictly modern, greater than or equal to or less than it goes through the sequence?
3:53
We want to find a limit of four all values of our on four for like and as and approaches infinity like for example,
4:04
if the if there are some like initial values where the sequence you want to bone
4:13
is actually exceeds the bounds that opening sequences we are planning to use.
4:17
So let's look at the statement of this theorem. Let's look at the statement of this theorem.
4:23
So let's look at the statement.
4:30
So we have to.
4:34
Bounding sequences, Allen and U.N. right now is a no l l is the limit of our sequence that we're interested in the sequence and and we have
4:39
the wrist some and in natural numbers such that the end is less than or equal to and is less than or equal to you.
4:52
And so there is they need to this inequality needs to be satisfied, but not necessarily straight away, but eventually right after a certain capital N.
5:02
Do you see that? Yep, yep, so this is what we need to prove in order to apply the Sandrich Theorem.
5:20
OK, so we need to be able to prove this. Thank you.
5:28
So in that case, we have as a conclusion that the limit of again is.
5:38
OK, so in that case, we can conclude this, so for this hour example, someone over in.
5:47
The way we prove this is basically we know that sign up end is bounded between minus one and one.
5:58
Yeah. You agree with that?
6:05
Yeah, so if we do divide, well, all sides in this inequality, by end we get this inequality.
6:11
Which holds for all the end and in fact, for all that land, greater than zero.
6:27
Yeah, so we can divide four, all right, by little end, if the end is greater than zero, because we wouldn't be able to divide by an equal zero,
6:37
but we're not really interested in that because our bound because what we're really interested in is for and greater than or equal to one.
6:48
And therefore, we actually have this inequality. For every person that is of interest to us so we can take here.
6:57
We can take the capital end to be one year.
7:12
Does that make sense? Yeah, it makes sense. Thank you. So and we are done.
7:18
So the we have just all we need to apply. All we need to apply the SandRidge Theorem is this and we're done.
7:25
We have proven that the limits of our sequence of this sequence here is zero.
7:36
So we're basically done. Okay, that's the that's the graph that we've got in Python.
7:46
So to demonstrate the Sandrich Theorem and.
7:53
Let us consider the proof of the salvage theorem so we know that the two given sequences L.N. and you n tend to the same Liberta.
8:00
So we can apply the definition of convergence for both these sequences, how do we apply?
8:13
Well, the definition of convergence to a limit given some absolute greater than zero,
8:19
we can find what we can find to apply these things at one for each sequence we can
8:24
find and one and we can find and to such that for all and greater than in one,
8:29
the first sequence will be within epsilon limits and for all and greater than and two.
8:36
The second sequence is going to be with an episode of the. So the idea which which end do we then pick?
8:47
Which end do we then pick, do we pick and wonder if we can do something else?
8:56
We want both these inequalities to be satisfied.
9:04
Yep, we want both these inequalities to be satisfied, so we pick what do we pick the biggest one out?
9:11
The time we pick the biggest one out of the two. So we do this.
9:19
Because we want both inequalities to be satisfied and we know that there will be both satisfied if we pick the maximum of one and and two,
9:24
and in that case, if we do take the maximum, then we have this situation that we have both these inequalities satisfied.
9:37
But we also know we also know that the land is less than us, and therefore we actually have L minus Epsilon.
9:48
Is less than L.N., is less than UN, is less than L plus Absolom as a consequence of these inequalities.
10:01
Do you guys agree? Yes.
10:11
OK, so that gives us what? So we also know that there is some GNR notice that we didn't use and here we used and Dush and Prime.
10:22
We also know by the assumption of the sandwich theorem that there is a certain end in natural's such that we have this inequality.
10:38
For all little and then right, therefore, we now take.
10:49
Or little MS greater than the maximum of and dash that we know that all of
11:01
these conditions will be satisfied and we know for the for these little ends,
11:06
we actually have this and sandwiched between these things.
11:13
But we also know that the limiting inequalities are satisfied. So we have this.
11:18
We only really care about this side of the inequality.
11:29
So we only really care about this. We only really care about this, and if we just take El.
11:37
If we take over here. We actually end up with this inequality here and notice that we have double implications, so we have if and only everywhere.
11:54
Right, we have double implications if anon leaves, so.
12:09
In fact, we conclude that and minus l, the modulus of that is less than Epsilon.
12:15
That's what we conclude with, so we have now shown well, because Littleton was just an arbitrary number larger than the maximum of these guys,
12:27
we have shown that our sequence converges to L as a result.
12:39
And we have actually determined the you know, where this convergence starts.
12:48
Well, it's actually going to be the maximum of this and dush, which combines two such and values for the convergence of the two bounding sequences.
12:54
Any questions on this? That's the proof of the sandwich theorem.
13:06
Well, I'm a little bit confused about the last page. So how do I remove the absolute.
13:10
In the lobby here. You mean here?
13:18
A which which last bit specifically, I mean, last page. RAYOS page or the previous page, yes.
13:27
Yes, so how do we cut the final step throughout the last from the.
13:40
Do you mean this? Yeah, how do I remove that absolute value?
13:48
How can you rewrite this inequality? So we can rewrite it as so let me just rewrite it so.
13:53
So I guess so, as my list is long, it's smaller than.
14:20
You earn. Minus else, as far as I right, so let us basically just rewrite it.
14:27
Let me just show you how to rewrite this. So this inequality is saying so let me do it in in the markdown thing just a second.
14:38
So if I go back to the lock down. So let me share with you this.
14:50
So your question really is this. Your question is how do we get from how do we get from this?
14:58
How do we get from this, how do we get.
15:21
So that that was, I think, your question.
15:40
Yeah, but this inequality. This inequality is equivalent to.
15:46
Or this inequality. To switch to the monitor, OK, we know that, and now we just take El.
16:02
The other side, so we have L minus Epsilon messed up and less than Epsilon less than L, but separately we just take it to the other side.
16:33
So does that answer your question? Yes, I got that.
17:00
Thank you. OK, excellent. So. Let's press on.
17:04
OK, that's how we got these inequalities, so there is yet another technique which is useful for proving convergence, and that's the ratio test.
17:23
Its name stems from the fact that it compares the ratio of consecutive terms in the sequence.
17:35
So this test can be used to verify whether a sequence converges to zero or diverges to zero, specifically to zero.
17:41
But this is not really a limitation, right?
17:49
If the sequence B N has a non-zero limit, then we can apply the ratio test to the modified sequence and were an equals B and minus that limit.
17:52
Right. If we can prove that this sequence converges to zero, we prove that we n Convergys did OK.
18:06
So if the modified sequence passes this test, we know that it can go to zero and so the end converges to help.
18:15
So let's look at the ratio test the ratio test for sequences. Let see be such that C is in this in this interval.
18:23
So I suppose that there is some capitaland in natural numbers such that for all little and greater than or equal to capital and we have this.
18:38
Yeah. Right, that this ratio, the modulus of this ratio is less than or equal to see,
18:50
then the limit of this sequence is going to be zero and this is the ratio of consecutive terms in the sequence.
18:59
So you remember when we are looking at cautious sequence, we were not looking at consecutive terms.
19:10
We are looking at terms that were one after the other, but there were not necessarily consecutive.
19:14
Here we are looking at consecutive terms. Right, so here we're looking at consecutive terms.
19:19
So let's look at a specific example.
19:27
Let's look at the sequence three to the power of minus 10.
19:33
So. So what does the sequence look like?
19:39
Let's have a look at it. Speak to the power of Monness and.
19:57
So this looks like that. Does it look like the sequence converges?
20:36
Yes, and what does it converge to? There are zero.
20:48
So I think we should be able to to prove this right.
20:54
So let's prove that it converges to zero. And for that, we're going to apply the regular test here.
20:57
Can you have your your hand raised? Yes, sir.
21:06
It is about something you mentioned previously.
21:09
Thus, do the terms we have to be considering have to be consecutive or can we put any end plus something else like two or three,
21:12
for example, for ratio tests that need to be consecutive.
21:21
But don't confuse that with the definition of the corsetry sequence, right?
21:27
In the definition of the code, we have an minus a.T.M, but they are not necessarily consecutive.
21:33
My concern is whether for such a sequence that has sort of like a cycling, for example, assigned end over end, that actually still converges,
21:43
but if you if you pick a correct cycle length to to to test Silcock consecutive terms,
21:55
then it makes more sense for the ratio theorem, for the ratio test.
22:03
So the ratio test needs to hold eventually after a certain capitaland.
22:08
Right. So even if the sequence oscillates, if we go far enough in the sequence, I think we can still bound these guys like this.
22:19
We venture because the amplitude of these oscillations is getting less basically for for the example that you gave.
22:31
So so it's not actually possible to give a different number and plus one do use a different number,
22:41
but from and plus one in this test note, because the test is actually this is how the test works, right.
22:48
It's defined four consecutive terms.
22:54
But even if the sequence even if you consider the sequence such as sine and over in the sequence that we considered here,
22:56
I mean I mean, it would probably be it would I mean, it's such a natural sequence for the sandwich theorem, right.
23:04
That it doesn't really make sense to use a ratio test. And still, I think you can you could use the ratio test if you really wanted to.
23:14
OK. Right, you just go far enough into the sequence, right, and you prove that the ratio of consecutive terms is less than see.
23:22
I see. I think you can still do it. OK.
23:31
But it's just harder than using the Sandrich Theorem for that particular sequence.
23:37
OK, thank you. So we looked at the sequence three to the minus, and, yes, I just wondered,
23:42
why are you considering aid plus one is less than a year like it's a degreasing sequence.
23:51
Is that necessary? So it's a test, right?
23:56
So basically, if this ratio. If the ratio of the modularly.
24:01
Right, if the ratio of the modularly so we're looking at the ratio of the modulate, does it have to be a decreasing sequence then?
24:07
Because you're saying see belongs to 021, so you're assuming it's a degrading sequence, but isn't it true that could be increasing as well?
24:19
What about the sequence here? What about the sequence here?
24:26
What about this sequence? Could we not still apply the Raksha test and it's at an it's an increasing sequence.
24:40
What do you think? Let's see, would be exciting one.
25:08
We didn't really know, but we're considering modulate, right, we look at the look at what we are what we're using here, we're using the Modula, right.
25:20
So you're still have a bigger negatives, like bigger and absolute turn of a of a negative number.
25:34
Exactly. So this minus sine will disappear from from here.
25:42
We're still we're still good.
25:51
Yeah, yeah, that it make sense, but my question is, so they shoot us, will only work for the closing sequences or the negative side.
25:53
But what if there's a sequence that increases in the positive side still, which is limit?
26:02
Results in a on a positive side, but how can it reach a limit of zero, right?
26:08
If it's to zero? This is. This only works for the limit of zero.
26:19
OK, thank you. Yup. If you have a sequence, right, if you have a sequence and you want to apply to a sequence which does not converge to zero,
26:28
which converges to something like L I think this is your example actually.
26:39
Right. Then to apply to apply the derazhnya test to such a sequence,
26:44
you need to subtract its limit from the sequence and apply the ratio test to this shifted sequence.
26:51
Yep, so you shifted basically below, you know, if you have a sequence, you should below the the x axis, does that answer your question?
27:01
Thank you so much, sir, you need to apply it like this, so there is another race called.
27:14
Yeah, explain why why it only applies to zero,
27:22
because we'll look at the proof of this limited strike and we'll see that basically if this condition is satisfied,
27:29
then the sequence converges to zero. Right?
27:36
It's not a universal test. Right. It's just used in that specific situation where the sequence converges desired by.
27:39
We'll see why when we look at the proof. Xinyang, you have the question.
27:46
Yes, so if we need to, like, modify the sequence to make that call to zero and then we need to, like, add them back later, right?
27:57
Well, if that sequence, which we have modified, if we do prove that it can go to zero.
28:08
This also shows by the rules of of the sequences. Right.
28:16
By the ducks can go to [INAUDIBLE]. Right.
28:20
Because remember that we have the combination of sequences, results, these ones.
28:23
Right. So, in fact, we we applied this guy and we conclude that the original sequence converges to L.
28:32
So we thought we need to prove by ourself that the cost to limit how constant
28:44
it's constant or when we can just use that need to know what the limit is.
28:50
Right. This is the limitation of these approaches. You need to know what the limit is, but you can subtract it.
28:56
So if I have a constant follow, I still need to, like, prove that.
29:04
The limit of that constant is that constant, you know, that the limit of a constant is a constant, right?
29:09
It's obvious if you think of a constant sequence, right.
29:17
Its limit is is a constant. It's that constant.
29:22
But it's just clear from the definitions, you don't even need to be honest.
29:36
I mean I mean what I said, this is an overkill. You don't really need even the combination theorems.
29:39
It's clear that if if the end converges to Convergys to L and they only cause B and minus L, so if if they sequence Bilpin.
29:44
Yeah. If A equals Bournvita cell and that converges to zero, it's clear that beyond converges to L.
29:59
It's quite easy to to show that right, but you even need to show that.
30:11
So let's look at the ratio test, right.
30:16
For this sequence that we have just considered. The ratio test is just this just gives us a third, which is clearly less than one.
30:21
So we can choose C to be one of the three in this definition.
30:32
So we don't don't forget that we need to have the seat so we can choose it to be one or one over three.
30:36
And we can we can take and to be one.
30:43
And the ratio test is satisfied. Right.
30:47
Therefore, we have just shown that the sequence has as its limit zero.
30:51
Any questions of that? OK, so the limit ratio test, so we use the ratio test, right, just the ratio test for convergence.
30:57
Yes, Lydia. So if we have a sequence that does not pass the racial test,
31:12
does it make it count diverges or like maybe it has to like another constant or to something else?
31:19
No. So it doesn't say right. It doesn't say that.
31:29
Then it doesn't say if an olive. Right, let's look at the statement of the Asia test.
31:33
It doesn't say. If and only if it doesn't say that if the limit is zero, then we have this.
31:42
It says if we have this, then we have this.
31:51
And like to, um, the first slide for racial test obsessed, like it's to verify whether a sequence converges to zero or diverges.
31:58
So if a sequence does not pass, it doesn't show anything or no, it doesn't really show anything like that.
32:09
Look carefully at the statement. Right. It doesn't say that if this is not satisfied, then this is not true.
32:20
It says if this is satisfied, then this is true. So this is a sufficient condition, it doesn't say it's a necessary condition.
32:28
OK, so there is a related test called the limitation test, and it also works by considering the limit,
32:39
the the ratio of consecutive terms in the sequence, but it actually considers the limit of that duration here.
32:49
We will we were lucky to find that this ratio is just one over three.
32:57
But let us consider let's consider this other test.
33:04
Suppose that the limit. Of this ratio exists, and if this limit if R is less than one, then the sequence and converges to zero.
33:09
This is called the limit ratio test limit ratio test.
33:24
OK, so if this limit exists and if it is less than one, then we have convergence to zero.
33:30
So this is another test limit test.
33:38
Look, there is this limit here, OK? That's the limit ratio test.
33:41
So we consider a sequence were and equals one or N factorial.
33:47
And if we consider this ratio of consecutive terms or actually the modulus of this ratio, we find that it is equal to one over N plus one.
33:56
It's equal to one over one plus one. But in the limit, in the limit, this quantity one around plus one.
34:09
Is less than or equal to. They have.
34:34
Right. So we can deploy. The limited nature test.
34:42
In this case. The limited nature test boxes.
34:51
In fact, this limit is equal to zero. Right, so the sequence one over N factorial.
35:05
Converges to zero. Limitation test.
35:16
So we can prove the correctness of these tests, so we are given let us look at the racial test, let us look at the racial test first.
35:27
Yes, there is a raised hand.
35:39
C is defined as less than equal to see less than one, equal to one, does the test fail or does it conclude that it diverges?
35:43
So let's look at the definition of the test. It doesn't conclude.
35:52
It never can conclude that something diverges.
35:57
Right, it doesn't this test doesn't conclude that something diverges, the test fails, so we cannot prove convergence, right.
36:02
But it doesn't prove divergence. Also, even if we get a sea value like to, then it still concludes that the test fails.
36:08
Well, you haven't been able to apply the test, right. But you cannot. But that doesn't tell you anything about the sequence.
36:18
Yuck. So if you get evaluated, see larger than one, then we still cannot conclude that divergence.
36:25
You have to do another test. You have to do something else. Yes. So you look very carefully at the definition.
36:31
It says if you have managed to prove this, then yes, then the limit of the sequence is zero.
36:37
But it doesn't say if it's not possible to prove that.
36:42
What are the consequences? It doesn't say that. So you need to work carefully according to the definitions.
36:46
OK, thank you. Yeah, so for ratio tests, we can look at the we can look at their correctness,
36:54
we can look at the correctness of the racial tests, we can prove the correctness of the racial tests.
37:03
That's in the notes. But I'm so mindful of the time.
37:08
So let me skip the Spruill for the for the time being and let us consider some sequences.
37:11
So if we have a function. We have a sequence, right, and then we take a subset of natural numbers,
37:20
then the restriction of this function to this subset of natural numbers is called the subsequence of.
37:30
So using our usual notation for sequences.
37:39
This sequence of the sequence would be in the form like this, where an eye, a positive integers like that.
37:45
So, in fact, our subset is just the set of all of these are nice,
37:56
so we take a subset of the terms of the sequence, put them in a sequence, and that gives us the subsequence.
38:00
That's that is that kind of clear.
38:08
So, for example, we have a sequence, one over N, which is one one over two, one, two or three, one or four and so on and so forth.
38:11
So this is a sequence of the sequence. Right, one over two, one, two, four, one or six and so on.
38:19
And this is a sub sequence of the sequence, right?
38:28
So these guys are the sequences of the original sequence, one of them.
38:31
And it's important to know that any sort of sequence of a convergent sequence converges to the limit of the sequence.
38:38
Any subsequence of a convergence sequence converges to the limits of the sequence,
38:48
and it's straightforward to prove this, so we have a convergent sequence.
38:55
And we consider some subsequence of this convergence sequence,
39:03
if Epsilon is greater than zero, is given by the definition of convergence to the limit,
39:07
there exists of capital and greater than zero such that such that the limiting inequality holds.
39:13
But it also holds for any greater than or equal to I.
39:20
Well, actually, let let me be a bit more precise by definition tonight,
39:29
greater than or equal to right by definition and I is going to they're equal to
39:34
I therefore for I greater than nd we have the limiting inequality for a and
39:38
I and this proves that the subsequence converges to the same limit and the
39:46
proof that for sequences that converge to plus or minus infinity is similar.
39:54
Can this sequence have a finite length, no. By definition, a sequence is a function from.
39:59
From an infinite set to real numbers, you see, it says infinite sums, it is an infinite subset of of of the natural numbers.
40:09
So there is another raised hand. Yes.
40:24
You do you seen.
40:30
The the subsequence of a sequence will converge to the same limits of the sequences convergence easier than the subsequence also converges to zero.
40:33
That's direct. OK, any such sequence of a convergent sequence converges to the limit to the sequence.
40:45
OK, thank you. We have just proved this. Yes, just going so, you know, like the eye, what does that actually like, refer to?
40:53
I hear. Yes, it's indexing the terms that we took for the subsequent so, for example, in a subsequence we may take.
41:10
So if and if the original term. Right. Let me perhaps.
41:23
So these are just positive integers with N1 less than and to less than two and three and so on.
41:28
So these are just the terms of the original sequence that we picked to be in the Subsequence.
41:36
So it is an increasing oh, OK, no, nothing good, and one and two and three are indeed increasing.
41:47
Yeah. Yeah, these numbers are indeed increasing.
41:57
But the subsequence itself doesn't have to be increasing.
42:07
Here is another important result about Subsequence is any sequence of real numbers has a monotonic subsequence.
42:14
Any sequence of real numbers has a monotonic subsequence.
42:23
And how do we prove that? Well, we consider a sequence and we say that the term Amn is a peak of the subsequence if and is greater than or
42:28
equal then and for all and greater than or equal to a strictly increasing sequence will have no peaks.
42:42
Well, in a decreasing sequence, every term is a peak.
42:52
And now there are two cases,
42:56
although there are infinitely many peaks than the subsequence of peaks is monotonically decreasing or there are only finitely many peaks.
42:58
And then we can choose to one greater than the index of the last peak plus one.
43:08
We know that T1 is not a peak. Therefore there exists some NP greater than T1 such that as to equal.
43:17
To this end we have this inequality satisfied and in this way we can we can basically construct a monotonically increasing sequence.
43:27
And that proves that every sequence of numbers has a monotonic subsequence.
43:39
Every sequence of numbers has a monotonic subsequence. So what?
43:52
Well, if the original sequence, it's not monotonic, such as something as equal to, say, X, yes, it will still contain a except sequence.
43:58
But it's not strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, it's maybe.
44:12
Take some specific oil that has not happened, and yet we can construct a sub sequence of the sequence, which is which will be monotonic.
44:19
Yep, so it's a split, even if the sequence is not increasing or decreasing, it contains the monotonic subsequence.
44:30
Any sequence of real numbers has a mix of sequence. So we have looked at manipulating modularly, right?
44:46
We have seen some useful rules for manipulating what you like, we have seen the triangle inequality.
45:00
There is another useful inequality, which is the reverse triangle inequality, which is this.
45:07
So that's it's useful to be aware of these four rules for manipulating modelling.
45:15
They're very useful when proving results about sequences and the general results about analysis.
45:23
So I'm not going to prove the triangle inequality, but the reverse triangle inequality.
45:31
But the proof is in the notes. Let us look at some properties of real numbers.
45:36
Now that we have looked at the limits of sequences of real numbers,
45:43
we will see how this relates to some fundamental properties of sets of real numbers.
45:46
These considerations would lead us to describe the so-called fundamental axiom of analysis.
45:53
Both irrational numbers and the real numbers have a linear order,
45:59
meaning that numbers X and Y are either X less than Y or why less than X or X equals one.
46:03
So we have an additional structure on these numbers, on the real numbers and on the rational numbers, which is defined by ordering.
46:13
I think there is a comment. Sign intersects infinitely many times a very stretched out line.
46:26
Yes, yes, so you do have a monotonically increasing and subsequence for Selex.
46:38
Yeah, so that horse. So will these lectures be uploaded to Panopto?
46:53
Yes. Kenneth Subsequence have a finite length, no.
47:02
OK, so we have bordering on numbers, right, so we have if we have a set of real numbers,
47:10
X and L and you are real numbers, then you is an upper bound of X.
47:21
If X is less than or equal to you for all X belonging to X, L is a lower bound of X, X is a set of real numbers.
47:27
If L is less than or equal to X, at least upper bound or supremo of X is an upper bound of S sort,
47:34
an upper bound S of X such that s is less than or equal to you for all upper bound U of X and the greatest
47:44
lower bound or Enfamil of X is a lower bound I of X such that L is less than or equal to pay for all.
47:52
Lower bounce events. So is the definition of the subsequence just like a subset?
48:02
It's similar. It's a similar idea, but a subset is a set, whereas the subsequence is a sequence.
48:09
Right, a subsequence of the sequence is itself a sequence.
48:18
So there is a notion of all basically the terms having structure so that they're indexed, right, they have the index.
48:28
And the indices are ordered. OK, so we say that a set X is bound to, but if it has an upper bound.
48:42
Yes, that's absolutely that's a good example, right? A set is bounded below, it has a lower bound.
48:56
And it is bounded if it has an upper bound and a lower bound.
49:06
So the least upper bound of a set X is unique.
49:12
If it exists, how would you prove that? How would you prove that a a bound an upper bound of a set is unique if it exists?
49:16
How would you prove that? Can we prove by contradiction?
49:26
Well, you sue you, you can assume by contradiction, you could say that there are two different up a bounce.
49:32
So there are two different least upper bounds.
49:39
You could you could have two different upper bounds, but you could not have two different degrees up a balance.
49:43
Right. It contradicts the definition.
49:49
Right. It contradicts the definition of the least upper bound.
49:53
So the least up about is unique, as is unique.
49:58
The greatest law about rights, the greatest little balance is also unique.
50:02
So here is an important axiom. And because it's an axiom, there is no proof.
50:08
It's an axiom. It's an axiom of the deck incompleteness of all real numbers.
50:16
Every non-empty subsid ex of the real numbers, all that is bounded above has the least upper bound, every non-empty subset ex of the real numbers.
50:22
All that is bounded above has at least up about.
50:34
The prison, please explain this.
50:44
What does it really say? I'm a little bit confused about what is talking about.
50:49
I don't I don't understand your question, actually, could you repeat it?
50:57
Could you please just explain what it's talking about, because I'm very confused about what they're talking about.
51:02
So if you have a subset of real numbers and it's non-empty, for example, one, two, three.
51:10
It is, and it is valued at above. Right, and it is bound to tip off.
51:19
Which is which it is bounded above by three, as a matter of fact, in this case, then it has a lease upper bound.
51:28
Well, it's bounded by three, four or five. If we take the subset one, two, three of real numbers, it's valdete above by three.
51:36
Right. It's also belted by four, it's also bound to develop by five, is also bandied about by six and so on.
51:47
It's also bounded about by six and a half.
51:54
But there exists a lease up about Namik three, right, so this taxi is telling you about the existence of the lease up about.
51:58
Tuition up about a sign of that is correct, one is the least up about that is correct.
52:12
So if the saxen weren't weren't true, then they wouldn't necessarily be released up about.
52:21
What exactly is the least up about versus upper bound here is the definition.
52:32
This is the definition of the least up bound. So is there any connexion between this and what you're talking about, something like the limit of.
52:38
Of real number, it's always a real number. It cannot be something else.
52:52
The limit. That is that is that is correct.
53:00
The limit is a real number. The limit is a real number, but we haven't.
53:07
So that's the incompleteness of of real numbers we have not yet proven because the completeness of real numbers.
53:12
So this set does not always have the largest element. Right.
53:39
If the state has the largest element, nd then it's least upper bound is also going to be enriched.
53:47
It's not going to be some different number if the set contains the largest element.
53:55
And that element is also the least up about. So in your example, the least upper bound will be N, not M.
53:59
But what if we have enough evidence that.
54:09
Yeah, it it may or may not be bound to tip up, so they set of what about the set of natural numbers, right.
54:14
It's a subset of real numbers. Is it bounded above? No.
54:21
Does it have at least upper bound? No, no.
54:31
Is it bounded below? Yes, but zero minus one, minus one and a half and so on, is it does it have the greatest flow of Belgium's?
54:39
Yes, yes, exactly. All right, I presume you guys have to go, right?
55:05
So I don't want to hold you any any longer, but we stop at the completeness detected completeness for real numbers.
55:09
Why is it an axiom? It depends on whether your construction of real numbers is synthetic or constructed.
55:19
I don't want to go into the detail of that, but it can be an axiom. It can be a theorem depending on how you construct real numbers.
55:26
Right. If you're really interested, look up the construction of real numbers.
55:33
It could be synthetic. It could be constructed. So these are technicalities.
55:37
Thank you. All right. And the question, are we doing serious next, where we are going to do something else before we do serious,
55:48
we're going to look at functions and we are going to look at integration.
56:00
It's the limit of the sequence, for example, the power of minus X minus and with the greatest level about zero,
56:07
the greatest lower bound is for sex, not for sequences.
56:17
Right, the greatest law bout is defined process, but you can think of the set of all terms of the sequence, right?
56:23
If that is bounded above, it will have a lease up about.
56:31
So, for example, etoposide minus 10 would be bound to be lowered by the power minus end will be.
56:38
Grounded below by zero. That's that's that's right.
56:51
Sixth graders know about. And because the limit of the sequence.
56:55
But it's bounded below, right, so. Basically, what we have here is.
57:04
Is this. So you are saying you are saying we have the function E to the government and.
57:14
We have this right. We have yeah, because it's it's it's always greater than or equal to zero.
57:40
Yeah, but would at least with the greatest bounty considered zero, even though it never reaches a.
57:56
Yes. OK. It doesn't have to attain, so the set may never attain it, but basically the bound,
58:06
the low about the least little about does not have to be in the set itself.
58:15
OK, as in this example, it's outside this set. Thank you.
58:21
But if you take one to three, then the the the least up about is inside the set.
58:27
Yeah, you see that it can be in the set, it can be out of the set, it depends depends on whether the set has the maximum element.
58:35
Thank you. So there are more questions, so if people are following the book, mathematical analysis,
58:45
straightforward approach before we go to series, we're going to do functions, continuous functions, and we're going to do integration.
58:55
And then we'll do a series.
59:05
The question is, is the approval of any any sequence unique as well as the upper bound of the man, then simply an upper bound?
59:14
Is it easy? No, no, no. Let's look at the example set.
59:25
One, two, three. Right. And again, just don't confuse the upper bound is not four sequences.
59:28
It's four sets. Right, the upper ground is four sets.
59:34
Let's take a set, one, two, three. Yeah, it has an upper bound three.
59:39
It has an upper bound for it has an up about five. It has an infinite number of upper bound.
59:45
The Applebaum can be a can is not necessarily the problem belongs to the state that we're talking about.
59:53
So let's look at the definition. It doesn't have to belong to the set.
59:58
So let's look at the definition carefully. Am I sharing the slides?
1:00:03
Let me show the slides just a second. Let me show the slides.
1:00:06
Next is a subset of real numbers. Yep.
1:00:16
Ellen, you are real numbers, you is an upper bound of X, if X is less than or equal to you for all X belonging to X,
1:00:21
but it doesn't say anywhere that you belong to that said.
1:00:29
It doesn't say that anywhere. It doesn't say, Ellen, you do belong to X.
1:00:36
And then similarly followable ultimately follow about, but then again, I'm a little bit confused with the least up, could you define that again?
1:00:42
So the least upper bound of ex is an upper bound S of X, such that X is less than or equal to you for all upper bound to you of X.
1:00:51
That's the definition of the least up about. So for one, two, three, that would be three.
1:01:04
That would be three, OK. For four years to the power of four E to the minus N, it will be zero.
1:01:11
So clearly the greatest low amount will be zero, even though zero is nowhere near nowhere in the set.
1:01:25
Does that kind of answer your question? Yeah, thank you.
1:01:40
So all these languages don't have to belong to this idea, like just look carefully at the definition, right?
1:01:58
You don't have to belong to X. The least upper bound also doesn't have to belong to or to the set.
1:02:04
It may or it may or it may not.
1:02:13
Just be very careful with the definitions, might just be very careful with what what the definition is you say.
1:02:21
I think there are a few more questions. So there are some raised Tansu, just just speak out.
1:02:38
Yeah, I want to ask something I don't suppose we ever said, how will we what do we write down in as one word and we write down to find that
1:02:55
you're sure that a number is an upper bound or lower wound or at least upper bound,
1:03:06
the greatest amount of that. So what we're trying to show basically. Well, you go by the definition.
1:03:11
So every time we are doing that, let's say a number is up or one of us that is up, we need to write the definition.
1:03:19
Yeah, you need to show this inequality. Basically, you need to demonstrate that this inequality also.
1:03:29
All right, then it will be an upper bound or.
1:03:35
Yeah. Some more questions. If he had a sentence about five minutes or past the up, the least up about may or may not be a member of the Senate.
1:03:42
There are these two examples, right, for example, one, two, three, the least upper bound is three.
1:04:04
It's in the set. If we consider minus E to the minus N.
1:04:11
The second all minus E to the minus, and for all positive N then the upper bound,
1:04:19
the least up to the least upper bound will be zero, but it will not be in the centre.
1:04:28
We are going to interrupt. Sorry. Oh, so you can prove that zero is indeed a law, let's say, but how will you prove that is the greatest law?
1:04:42
What will you need to show this, that that for any for any upper bound that this inequality holds?
1:04:51
So you need to find all the bones first? No, you just you don't need to find all up about that.
1:05:03
Could be an infinite number of them, right? Yeah, sure. They all satisfy this inequality for an arbitrary upper bound satisfies this inequality.
1:05:09
OK, so how do we get down to zero from this, how do we Watari, how do we get down to zero from this definition?
1:05:21
So. Get all values except zero, so that is the lowest value that it can't achieve.
1:05:36
So you can basically right that what Richard said as a statement that.
1:05:47
Yeah, you need to buy this. Well, you can you can do this using the definition of the limit of the sequence, for example.
1:05:53
Oh, OK. OK, got. You see what? Because the term in the example that I just gave you, I gave you an example convert this set.
1:06:00
Whose elements or a conversion sequence.
1:06:10
Limit store value, and so we know that it's OK, if it can't, then you have the liberty and equality than your liberty and equality.
1:06:15
Can you use the liberty and equality, liberty and equality to prove the definition of the stuff about.
1:06:23
Thank you. Yeah. Some other questions, hello, can you go back to the proof of Monotonically Quaintest?
1:06:32
Yes, I still don't quite understand, like the second case, can you, like, give examples?
1:06:44
Yeah, so there are two cases. I do understand what it peakers.
1:06:52
Yeah, so I'm just saying that there are either infinitely many peaks or there are finitely, many peaks.
1:07:00
If there are infinitely many peaks, then they form a sonic subsequence, if there are finitely many peaks.
1:07:10
Is this the case that you don't understand? Are you OK if there are finitely many peaks, then I look at the element which follows the last peak.
1:07:17
Yeah. Does that make sense?
1:07:31
OK, I look at the element that follows the last peak and I know that it is not a peak.
1:07:35
Because it comes after the last to be. And because it's not a peak, I know that there exists and greater than T1.
1:07:43
And at that end, we call it to.
1:07:54
There is an element to this, such that EIGHTY-ONE is less than 80 to.
1:08:00
Do you see that? All right. Thank you. And then I could do the same with T2.
1:08:08
I know that it's not a peak so I can find T3 83, which will be greater than 80 to.
1:08:14
And I can proceed indefinitely like that. Right.
1:08:22
And by doing that, I find a militant increasing sequence.
1:08:26
Thank you. Any other questions?
1:08:36
No more questions. Well, have a good day.
1:08:56
