Title: DM Nov 4 Lecure Recording

Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 05/11/2021
So this is the defining my final lecture with you. I think we can comfortably present the last bit of the course here.
0:05
It's going to be a little bit tricky in the sense of conceptually a little bit more difficult, but I'll try to make sure that you get you people.
0:16
Good, so this is the place where we got left on Tuesday,
0:31
where we talked about the an equivalence relation between sets, its it's I can't stress enough.
0:36
It's not officially an equivalence relation because it's not officially a relation,
0:45
because relations are only defined some sense, and we can't consider the collection of all sets to be set.
0:50
That's not not permitted. So the the symbol that we used as a notation between sets.
0:56
It acts as an equivalence relation. And the.
1:07
What we have is that we can we define that relation by saying that have existed by Jackson between the two sets?
1:15
And for some cases, that's fine. That case is pretty straightforward for the infinite cases.
1:24
It's a little bit more tricky.
1:31
So what we have now is the collection of infinite sets down the bottom of the slide, and some of these equivalencies are pretty straightforward show.
1:50
For example, the defect that the set of all natural numbers is equivalent to the set of all the even numbers.
2:01
And it's fairly straightforward.
2:09
Instead of all the primes, you have to show that there is infinitely many primes and we will now focus on the later collection of equivalences.
2:11
And for me, the most interesting bit in what we do today is this that sort of spin sets are not equivalent and the consequences of.
2:22
So what you're going to do is. Look, for example,
2:36
at the first equivalence that I've stated and which says that the natural set
2:43
of natural numbers and the citizen pairs of natural numbers are equivalence.
2:48
So what I need to do is establish a by election. And so this is what I'm going to do.
2:52
I'm going to argue that the objection exists by drawing a diagram.
2:58
I'm not defining the function exactly, but I'm showing the existence of the function, which in this case is enough.
3:03
And so I start by mapping the natural numbers onto the pairs of all the two sort
3:12
of set of all the pairs of natural numbers by starting on the left top corner.
3:21
Zero zero. I just my image was zero and then my aim is show one zero one.
3:26
Image for two is non-zero. Image four three two zero Image four four one Image four five two zero two minus four six two zero three seven,
3:32
etc. Now, so I walk through the grid one step at a time a while.
3:43
Every time that I make is that I count. And I say this is the image of an is the next number that I am counting.
3:50
It is possible to write this down in a formal definition. It's a bit convoluted.
3:58
You can write it in a little bit of computer code, for example, that counts as a function as well.
4:03
But it's that's not really the issue here. The issue is, does this give me a projection?
4:09
So you have to argue that it is indicative and such active?
4:15
Well, the first thing is that it is subjective because we.
4:20
So you need to pull up over the Syria conflict, so you have to argue that it is subjective.
4:30
First of all, so do those.
4:39
This method reach all pass and answer is yes, it does, because I am walking through the whole grid, systematically not skipping a single individual.
4:40
So this subject is this path that I'm walking injunctive.
4:51
Well, I never visit a node twice. That's clear and every nodes different from another node.
4:56
So this means that in every step that I make, I visited know that I haven't visited before, and therefore this path is in is an objective function.
5:04
No. So sometimes the diagram is enough to show the existence of objection,
5:16
but you have to be able to argue that it is subjective and you know, if you can't do that, then the diagram might be misleading.
5:22
And so did the task there is to show those two things. So we each pair and only once.
5:32
And therefore, this is a blank action.
5:39
OK, so this means that the the there aren't more elements in this set and squid than around the element in the set,
5:43
and it's the same size, the same number of elements. And it's a bit surprising because you would argue that,
5:52
you know there are many more elements in square for every element in and there is any number of elements in any square.
5:59
But irrespective of that, because this projection exists, you can argue, well,
6:07
this this sets have the same size to define carnality in a little while through this.
6:13
OK. Another example as a result that I hinted on when we started talking about cotillion products,
6:21
when we talked about can we drop the brackets in the product of a more on set?
6:28
And I said, No, you can't because you're dealing with different things. But we will we will show that there is an equivalence between there.
6:34
And of course, the equivalence between them is. Objection.
6:42
Now, so I can very easily define objection from the set on the left to just settle on the right by blocking a part.
6:45
The pad is on the left hand side in this pan and using the components to build the parents on the right hand side.
6:57
No, I can, so this is a well-defined function.
7:06
If you're if you don't like that, I'm having an affair as an element in the bear, which I'm doing, that I can specify this better.
7:10
I will do so in a few minutes. But first, I want to observe that I can immediately also define a function that goes back in a very similar notation.
7:20
And so the function G and refine codes on the right hand side and the left hand side, and it does a similar thing to the composition of the bands.
7:29
And it's very easy to show to F and G are each other's inverse.
7:39
So for those of you scratching your head, saying, well, is this is this particular definition here a valid way of defining a function, Melissa?
7:45
OK, OK. Let me do it like this.
7:55
I do find functions left and right on bass, and the left one takes the left hand component of the band and the right right hand component.
7:57
And I didn't define my function, F,
8:09
which takes a pair and an element in C and a motor to left B and then composed with the pair composed of the right of B and Y.
8:12
And very similar for G. Yeah.
8:26
So and so this is formally a better definition because I do not have federal matching, so you can argue these issues as patronising.
8:29
And this is, of course, not a valid definition in mathematics.
8:39
So this is a both of mathematical definition. But since this represents exactly what I had to for.
8:43
Now this is is not necessary. I can always do this.
8:50
So the set of even numbers. Yeah.
8:59
Even natural numbers is that a is the same size as set.
9:04
The numbers have already agreed to this. And the point is just because we can find a by election between those two sets.
9:09
And if the bush action is defined by saying that the average two times and.
9:15
Now, of course, the inverse is the function that takes half.
9:20
Yeah, but of course, not all the functions from even to end are by ejections.
9:25
So you have to be careful when you establish the equivalence between these sets because the function that you're writing down,
9:31
you have to check that it is indeed the punch, actually, not just the surge action.
9:37
Now, for example, if you take an entity here,
9:41
then the this would give me a function that is injected from the even numbers to end, but not the surge action.
9:43
So in the sense criterion is that I have to find it by Jackson, there would not be enough.
9:52
Yeah, it's a burden for me to be able to state that even in our equivalent.
10:02
I just need to show the existence of objection either by stating what the objection
10:09
is as I've done there or by giving a diagram that argues that the objection exists.
10:14
So we can now lift the notion of conditionality, but so far we've defined only for finite sets to infinite sets as well.
10:24
And we do that using an observation that you can make is that we have to.
10:34
So if the number of elements of the set A is the number and then I can map and build a by section from the said, want to end on to a.
10:40
Yeah, but this is characteristic function of age on C of C if I is a subscript I.
10:52
Now, and if I have to find out since that has the same number of elements,
11:01
then I can build using this characteristic function objection from A to B by.
11:06
So this is a projection so I can take the inverse.
11:14
So I admit the element in a two to sequence two to the number in the sense long two and I then apply C of B to that number to get in the element A.
11:17
Yeah, it's very straightforward to check that this is a projection because here we are working with the composition of two projections.
11:30
The ACA is a projection. Therefore the inverse is as well and composition of objections as a bunch, actually.
11:38
And again, no. So it is minister for finite, it's safe to have the same number of elements they they are equivalent to just a projection between them.
11:44
And we lift this property to the infinite case where we now say that we say the two sets have the same kind of analogy.
11:56
If if a projection exists, so we no longer talk about the number of elements in the set,
12:06
although that is implied and we will see in a few minutes that you can't talk always about the number of elements because sometimes the size of,
12:12
say, there's not a natural number and the commonality of descent expressed through
12:21
the vertical bars as before is defined by the existence of the by injection.
12:31
So A and B have the same cut analogy energy or as the size very ambitious equal if there exists a projection.
12:37
Now this is especially when, when and like I said, when we look at large sets, then this is not the number.
12:45
And therefore this equality is is you need to discuss exactly what it is now, but at least it intuitively clear for the moment.
12:55
So one of the the great things that Gil Counter did, and he did many great things,
13:07
by the way, he's a wonderful mind that a lot of functional function theory.
13:14
So he discovered that there was more than one notion of infinity and that when he came up with this result,
13:20
it's caused quite a storm for the for the philosophical side of mathematics because people said, this is this has to be nonsense.
13:29
Of course, there's only one notion of infinity. You know, it goes on and on and on, and that's that's all you need for infinity.
13:37
But as as will be clear from the result of presenting now,
13:45
you can actually define a hierarchy of infinity is all very, very much larger, larger than the next.
13:49
OK, so the the property that couple shows is he doesn't even talk about infinity large sets.
13:58
He just says that the asset and its power set can never be equivalent,
14:06
so there cannot be a function from a to the power of A that is in particular distances is what the proof shows.
14:13
There cannot be a function from aid to the power set of a that is subjective, you know?
14:21
So it shows that every attempt that you make in building such a function will miss a particular subset.
14:26
So there's always a subset missing however you try. And the the the construction looks very much like Russell's paradox.
14:32
It is as affinity to that. But it's defined better because the because of the fact that we are working with sets, you know.
14:42
So if I take, for example, just to illustrate the construction of the proof I take to set a just of two elements,
14:53
then the deposit of A has four elements.
15:01
So it's immediately clear that you cannot be a projection between these two sets that the positive is just too large.
15:04
So the thing that I'm doing now, I'm constructing a set B that is the set that's going to be missed by the function.
15:13
Now, so if I have a function funded aid to the outset of a down and defining B as the
15:22
collection of all the A's that are not an element of the image in the image of F,
15:29
yeah. So the image of F picks a subset here, and for all the elements in a I can check each one in the image of one.
15:35
And it's two in the image of two. So these are valid questions because the image of each number is a subset.
15:45
So defining be like this. But do I get, for example, if I take this function, f is equal to the set to an f of two Cisco the said one two.
15:54
Then what would be B? Well, B says one is not in two and two is to show two is in, the two is in the image of itself.
16:06
Yeah. So it occurs in that one doesn't. So one is not in the image said.
16:17
So B contains the set one piece at one.
16:22
If a no take another function. No, it's OK. But at the end, let me try it again and say OK, one, two, one and two two said one two.
16:29
Then this sent all the elements in a inside image on the graph and therefore the
16:38
said that a big so this said that I created the empty set and the empty set is a,
16:47
uh, an element of the Powerset, but it is missed by this f.
16:53
Now, as to said, containing one is not in the image of F.
16:58
OK, so if I now tried to fix this, so I might want to do the empty set and two to send one,
17:05
then be becomes instead one to now the both mould inside the image on the F.
17:13
So they said they're in the final case, it's clear that this works because,
17:22
you know that the any function from aid to the powers that have a will at most opaque to subsets you picked the said that is not included in there.
17:26
The beauty of the construction is that this definition gives you that sense, gives you the said.
17:36
That is not a not in. OK.
17:41
Good. So you can go on and on and on, you can look at all the possible combinations he has for the two combinations of functions that.
17:47
What, 12 even. OK. So did all that, Ole Miss has said and is all perfectly valid, said Wallace,
18:00
said they are missing their miss more than one set, of course, because they have to miss two cents.
18:09
But Walzer says they are missing is defined by through the definition of B.
18:13
So this is a perfect, nice construction and counter shows that this works for all sense.
18:19
So what he does is he says they could set a week on the show today and about Powerset of a not equivalent.
18:27
OK, well, first of all, we take a function for a two hour set of eight.
18:36
OK. And yawn. And then B, we say, OK.
18:41
I define the said b as before.
18:46
So is the collection of all the elements in a that are not inside to set that f match
18:51
them to say X doesn't occur in effects and it is a subset of a perfectly well-defined.
18:57
So the whole worry about the Russell Paradox becomes non-existent because we are not stepping outside the definition of sets we are.
19:04
Still, this is a perfectly well-defined subset of thing.
19:13
And so what we're going to do now is we're going to assume that everything's subjective now and then we go towards a contradiction.
19:16
So we have the function of the not subjective. Good.
19:23
So if F is subjective, then this particular set is in the image of F so I can find an element B in a subset F of B is that particular B?
19:29
So if I have subjective that this would be must be met on two, and now we go to the similar kind of construction that we had with the Wilsons Paradox.
19:44
We have cases now, so we now have to check if B occurs in B or if B does not occur and B now either.
19:54
One of these things has to be the case now because B is a subset of A and B is an element of A.
20:03
And therefore this has to be true. So let's start with the first case.
20:09
If B is an element of B, then B satisfies this.
20:15
Now, so this means that B is not an element of F of B, not small b,
20:21
so I know that B is not known as B by the definition of the set B, but I also know that F of B is equal to capital B.
20:28
So I know this goes as well, so I know that B is not an element of B, which is a contradiction to the to the case.
20:39
OK, that's fine. This means that the other case has to be true.
20:47
So B is not an element of B now because that's the conclusion that so that there has to be it.
20:50
So we do data analysis and we say, OK, well, it should be more b then because everybody is B and we know that B is not an element
20:57
of evolve b and therefore it satisfies the criteria for the construction of B,
21:09
and therefore it has to be in b again contradiction.
21:15
So we've defined as Set B using F, and we have shown that it is impossible for that said,
21:21
to be inside the image of it now because if we say that it is inside the image of F, we get a contradiction.
21:30
In both cases? So I cannot find an element in a such that as much that element onto the dissent be.
21:37
So therefore, this function is not subjective and therefore it is not being checked.
21:46
So any function from a to the power set of A cannot be a subjective function.
21:53
Therefore,
22:00
any threat from eight to the powers that be cannot be objection and therefore there exists no objection from aid to the power settling for all a.
22:01
Now, I need this to do to sink in a bit,
22:19
because it's it's a it's a it's a bit of a head scratcher because especially because you you flip between these notations,
22:22
you know, so I'm open to any questions you might have.
22:30
Like, for example, okay, you do that again, please. So, well, you certainly does the is no stability because I forgot to crank up my volume.
22:39
Yeah, go ahead. So we need that there is to be such sort of B is equal to the capital B means.
22:52
So I repeat so ask asking what this means. Yes.
23:06
So this means that if Map's small B to capital B.
23:13
Yeah. Yeah. But I have no idea is what it's like.
23:19
So, OK, so let's look at the case, so please bear with me, I'm going to ask you some questions and you need to answer.
23:28
Is this the definition clear to you? Yes.
23:35
OK. So Bill contains all the elements in aid that do not occur in the image, on the left, in their image on the Earth.
23:40
OK, good. So now if this is subjective, if his objective function, then B has to appear in the image of F.
23:49
Yeah. So all the subsets in a are mapped on to by if if!
24:05
A subjective. This is a subset of AA, and therefore F has to map on to be.
24:10
Is that clear? So I'm starting here, I assume, and there, yeah.
24:22
So this is the and focussing on the. So we'll sort of be the capital.
24:34
So, so let me call back again, so first of all,
24:43
I find B as the collection of all the elements in A that are not occurring in the image of on the in the image on the f no f maps elements to subsets.
24:47
So for every one of those bears element and subset, you can ask does the element occur in the subset?
25:00
And for all the elements in a foolish that is not true, that elements get stuck in to be.
25:08
So Bill contains all the elements in a debt that do not occur in the image on the Earth.
25:15
OK, so it seems like other points, it's that B, it's an element of the power set off a is this?
25:23
Oh, I got that. If you that because it's defined as all the elements in a such.
25:32
So this is a subset definition. Oh, so well, you know, it has to be an element there, it has to be one of them because these are all the subsets.
25:38
This is a subset, so it be has to so be an element of the powers that are very.
25:50
So that's why we need to have a piece of the IFB as you go to the capital B. It's positive on the issue of subjective.
25:55
Yes, exactly. So by definition, if very subjective and you can find an element in a that is mapped onto B by F now.
26:04
So there existed B in a source should ever be as b.
26:14
Oh, it's clear. Yeah. OK, I know you answer for the benefit of the rest.
26:19
Yeah. So, you know, ask yourself the question does b occur and b or not?
26:24
Because that's the you always say it's true or false.
26:30
We have established by the definition of sets that if you have an element in a and you have a subset of a day of age and you can ask the question,
26:33
doses at event occur on the set or not. No. So that's what we're doing here.
26:42
So this is the the question we ask which one of these two is true.
26:47
And we see that the analysis gives us a contradiction. In both cases, because FP is in beta and B is in the element of f small B,
26:52
and therefore it cannot be because in B only pick two things that do not satisfy that.
27:02
And if it is not an element, then b then it does satisfy the predicate and it should be NB.
27:08
So if it is not evident in B, then it is not in B, and if it is not, then B that it is and b so this is a similar contradiction cannot be true.
27:14
So in particular, you cannot find this objective function between the Senate and his spouse, and now it's a very important thing.
27:29
Good. So what does this give us? It gives us quite a remarkable feature.
27:38
So this means that the size of end and the size of the power set of end is not the same.
27:44
Now, this is a different cut analogy, which is different from the power of the powers,
27:51
other than which is the effect of the powers that have the powers of the positive them now.
27:55
So at this, I will illustrate today what is the difference in this step?
28:00
Yeah. So how? How big does it get? But we have established here through countless theorem that there is a hierarchy of infinity.
28:06
So this infinity is not the same as this infinity, and this infinity is not the same as it is if it is not the same as this.
28:14
So this it gets colossally big now. So we will.
28:23
But I mean, in the notes, there is an example that I give to its.
28:27
It has an asterisk on it, so it is not examined.
28:32
The but I do invite you to have a look at it where I show that the this said that there is equivalent to the set of all the rules.
28:35
So the power's out of end the same size of infinity as deep as a set of all the rules.
28:46
So this starts, I think when I when I first saw that as a as a med student,
28:55
I was really amazed because they are completely different things defined in completely different ways.
29:00
But you can argue that they have the same number of elements in them.
29:07
So that has existed by section. One of the remarkable things in mathematics is the question.
29:10
So let me do it like this. Yeah, to exist a measure of infinity in between and and the power set of it.
29:21
Now this is called the continuum hypothesis. So the hypothesis is that it says no know there's no different notion of infinity in between there,
29:31
but is one of those things that you can't really prove.
29:42
So the people have shown that using the actual decision of the the set theory, this is an unsolvable problem.
29:45
You can't prove that is false and you can't prove that that is true, which is again stunning.
29:52
It's such an easily formulated problem. Already is something that you can't do in mathematics.
30:00
So we don't know.
30:08
Officially, it still exists and the notion of infinity in between those two and therefore we don't know how to choose from there, etc., etc., etc.
30:09
So infinity is Infiniti's. I should say the hierarchy of infinity is unexpected, as I said.
30:19
But encounter came with this result.
30:26
A lot of people refused it, and he took quite a while for the community to settle down and accept that what he had discovered was it was true.
30:27
So this brings us to the final topic of the of the discrete mass course component of the of our our lectures.
30:40
And I want to talk to you about countable sets, and this is a feature that touches the computer science because accountable sets are
30:51
you can deal with in a in a nice way inside a computer and computer code uncountable,
31:05
it's become very difficult to represent. And I will give an illustration.
31:13
So we call it said countable. If it is a finite set or it is equivalent to seven initial numbers now,
31:19
which means that this immediately implies that if I ask you in an exam to check that is said is countable that you have to check two things.
31:31
Now you Ida and you say IDA finite or it is equivalent to because in the when I moved my exams,
31:42
the majority of students jump to this result and I completely ignore this one.
31:52
And because you are skipping half the possibilities you get after monks.
31:58
So it's very important that, you know exactly what's going to that means so accountability doesn't mean it is equivalent to end,
32:03
though it means it's finite or it is equivalent and.
32:11
Yeah. So, listen, this informally implies that accountable set can be listed as a finite or an infinite sequence.
32:17
So this means that you have an effective way of listing all the elements. Yeah.
32:27
Because if it is equivalent to end date, you can say, OK, well, the image of one is an element.
32:31
So the image used in Element Israel wants to Israel and Hezbollah.
32:37
Basically, what I'm doing now now. So this is listing the projection.
32:42
So an example is to show what we've seen already is that Square is going to bowl.
32:48
Yeah. So that's the thing that we have already established and will focus on, but also the entities accountable because it can easily list them all.
32:53
And I start with zero to minus one one minus two to three now.
33:01
So the I can even in this particular case, ride down dead by U.S.
33:06
Yeah, but it's dead. Again, it's not the necessary criteria.
33:10
So you don't have to write, go down and listing it like this is sufficient argument that you're going to visit all the elements.
33:16
Exactly. Once. Hmm.
33:26
I noticed that I mean, I do the only thing that I need to do is find a projection.
33:32
I do not need to find a projection that preserves the order. Or there's nothing to do with it.
33:36
I just map element to element. That's all I care about. So I can also show that he said of all the rationales is countable now.
33:41
And this is this is again occupied quite a mental leap because you can argue that you have far
33:56
more elements that are fractions from the numbers that are frictions and numbers that are whole,
34:02
you know, because there is some sort of queue.
34:09
And therefore, in all the fractions in between one and two, there are infinitely many fractions in between one and two.
34:12
So how can these two sets be the same? Well, we do did the same trick.
34:18
Now this is what is called the diagram that we have to walk.
34:24
So we are mapping. So I start with Q Plus.
34:28
So all the rationales that are positive, so not zero, but positive.
34:33
OK. And I can write all them as fractions of a one over one or two, one over three or four, etc. I got another and and two and three and a four.
34:38
So I have to. This is, as you can see, very comparable to and square.
34:51
Yeah. So this I can repeat it, replace each fraction by a de pair of B of a Q I replaced by B Gomo Q.
34:56
So then I have a mapping from end to end square. So this is the same diagram now, so I can walk through all the elements in this grid once.
35:06
So am I defining objection here? And unfortunately, the answer is no.
35:17
It's going to be subjective. I'm going to I'm going to hit all the all the fractions.
35:23
But for example, I'm going to one one and two, two and three, three and four for double the same number.
35:27
And so I'm going to revisit the same number, not just once more.
35:34
Not infinitely. Many times more like two, one and four, two and six three.
35:40
There are also all the same number now. So there is an infinite, infinite times, infinite waste in building this function.
35:47
So this is all a subject, and if I want to go to something, there's an injection I can.
35:59
I could skip the numbers that are for which the the the numerator and the divide are not called prime.
36:06
So for example, I removed the number two four and three six cetera and two over two and three, four, three and four.
36:15
If I remove all those and they keep all the benefits that I got prime and now I get something that is a injection as well.
36:23
Yeah, but it's a bit more difficult to do. OK, I will come back to it in a few minutes to why present example of this would be enough.
36:33
You know, I can consider this to be enough, but I need to establish novel results first.
36:45
And so this diagram shows that Q Plus is countable.
36:51
Yeah. And so I can also argue that your mind is this countable.
36:56
So I have all the numerator. I have a minus in front and then I can zip them up as I have done Vincent.
37:00
Yeah, so I can zip up. Like this, I have two sequences of lists of fractions I know zip them up like that.
37:08
I know that with zero different. And so I get that also.
37:18
Q Is this countable?
37:23
Go ahead. Would you mind going over like you count table one more time?
37:29
I couldn't wrap my head around it. Could you explain one more time or is that too much to ask?
37:34
Yeah, but you have to repeat your question and speak a little bit more slowly because the internet is not.
37:37
Could you please go over like you is going to bill one more time? I couldn't wrap my head around it.
37:44
OK. So do you understand the cue process? Countable?
37:49
Don't do it, do you want me to do that as well? It would be great if you could do that as well.
37:55
OK, so I start again here, so I list que plus so Q plus all the fractions to have a positive number in the numerator.
38:00
Yeah. So in a list and systematically in this great. So my first question is, do you agree with me that all the frictions appear in this great?
38:10
Yeah. I mean, all the factions that you can list.
38:22
Now, all all, all the elements include all the frictions that have a positive numerator, so not zero, but positive.
38:27
Do you agree that this creates this great represents them all?
38:35
Yeah. OK. So this path is going to hit all the numbers in Q Plus.
38:42
Yeah. Yeah. OK. But as I've argued, one one two, two, three three services, there was duplication in there.
38:53
So this is not an injection, it's just a surge action. Yeah.
39:02
Yeah. OK, good. So I can now clean the grid, open it a bit and write down the numbers that are called prime.
39:07
So dad down there is no repetition anymore. And then I have a.
39:15
By ejection from end to cue plus.
39:22
Yeah, so this is accountable, since I remember accountable sets out a finite or there was objection from end to the dissent.
39:27
This is not a finite set, so I have to establish that was a by ejection and the diagram Keirstead by ejection for for Q Plus.
39:36
In this case, it is the number of parts, a number of steps.
39:46
And the number of arrows that we drivers. So, so this is this is the image for zero, the image, we want the image to the image,
39:52
the three, the image for the image of five six seven eight nine ten.
39:59
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. So it is it is accountable set.
40:07
So no need to argue that if I. I want to establish that Cuba is going to boom.
40:13
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to build a new list and imposition of the list.
40:20
So the number of the new list starts with the number zero.
40:25
So there's the positions. Yeah, position starts with zero and then one, two, three four five, etc. All the old numbers.
40:29
Yeah. So in position one, I'm going to put this one in position.
40:37
Three, I'm going to put this one in position. Five, I'm going to put that one in position.
40:43
Seven, I'm going to put that one in position. Nine, I'm going to put that.
40:48
Yeah. So I skipped zero and a skip, all the even numbers. OK.
40:51
Second thing that I know is that if I put negative numbers in here in all the nominated this, I get a list for a Q minus.
40:59
So in the first position of the listed building, I'm going to put minus one over one in the third position,
41:12
I'm going to put minus two one in the fifth position. I'm going to put minus one over two in the seventh position to put minus one over three.
41:19
Perhaps I'm using the old numbers again, I'm using the other arms again. Yeah, that's just not clever because I erased what I just built.
41:29
Sorry. So again, so number one, is this one?
41:36
This is number three. This is number five. This is number seven digit number nine.
41:39
Yeah, minus this one is number two. Minus this one is number four minus digit number six minus number eight minus this number 10.
41:44
Yeah. So I have filled up all the even positions.
41:53
I filled up all the old positions. So this is what I call the zipping of the of the list, and this is comparable to what I'm doing here.
41:57
Yeah, yeah. And so the only thing that I need to add now is the number zero, and I put it in front two and position zero.
42:07
Yeah. So I can I can I have argued that you is accountable?
42:20
Okay, thank you. So this is and this is surprising because it is a it is a mercifully lighter
42:26
set in terms of how much effort does it take you to do to write them down?
42:32
It's counterintuitive because it's like I said, in between one zero and one, there are infinitely many numbers in queue.
42:39
And so it is it. It is counterintuitive, but the fact still stands the accused accountable.
42:47
So this means that the if I go to the.
42:56
To this list here, that queue is equivalent to end, and therefore a queue is not equivalent to the positive end.
43:00
I've argued at the positive end is equivalent to R, so therefore queue is not equivalent to all.
43:09
Good.
43:19
So we're going to try a little exercise, and it's a very nice moment, I think because it's yeah, so it's quarter two, so this we will do a break.
43:21
In the meantime, you can take the break whenever you want, of course, in about 20 minutes.
43:33
So this is 5:05. I'll come back and and do the solutions.
43:39
The first thing that I need before we go into the exercise, I need to discuss these three things.
43:45
Yeah. And so it is this less as an exercise in the notes, but I don't have time to go through them, so we just use them as as effective it.
43:49
True. So if I have a honour set and I have countable set B,
43:59
then I can say the following three statements are equivalent A's countable order exists a suggestion from B to eight or the an injection from A to B.
44:07
So both these properties, the second and the third, express that the said B does not have too many elements now, so you can map B onto A.
44:21
Now remember that the every element in B has to be.
44:36
Yeah, so, so so these are the the elements I've misspoke, the Element A has not too many elements.
44:50
Yeah. So you're mapping a into B, if you can do that in an A. Way,
44:57
that means that B has enough elements to take in all the elements of a because B is countable east and basically a subset of B,
45:02
and therefore it's gone as well. And if there is a suggestion from B to A.,
45:10
that means that it is possible to map all the countable elements in B onto an element in a so as not to launch.
45:15
Yeah. So this is not a light for an image, and this is a is not a large what it would mean.
45:24
OK. Using this property prove to these three statements.
45:30
OK. Like I said, 20 minutes, I'll be back and I'll we will go through this exercise.
45:37
I asked for a quick question. Sorry.
45:43
Ask a quick question before we go. Yeah, go. OK.
45:48
So when you say is not too large, do you mean that I?
45:52
It's like smaller or greater, smaller or you could to be.
45:56
But if I saw finance, I could not be like a smaller than the one talking about the kadhi narrative.
46:01
So I, it's like, has the same cannot be.
46:09
Is that what you mean? OK, perhaps I should have added, you know, it's a fair comment, I think I should have edited these infinite.
46:13
Yeah. Yeah. There's missing BP should be infinity launch.
46:25
Thank you for that. I changed it. There was a fishing of to the set of initial numbers down, so this there is never made a mistake.
46:29
So be here is an infinity line sent. So while you are on the break, let me do like to ask your question as well.
46:38
So I think we ask the question, well, of course you can, you know in your full knowledge when you described the definitions for a minimal and maximal.
46:52
You say that for something to be minimal for all,
47:04
be belonging to a it means related to it implies that means equal to a should not be B is greater than or equal to a.
47:09
Let me check. So the dead and large us ordering this, so I'm saying that is minimal.
47:19
If for all a old be in a if B is in the relation with A, then B and A has to be the same.
47:33
Yeah. So this means that every element that sits below a should be a itself.
47:45
So what are you suggesting that you want to write down now because it's so it talks about, ah yeah, know, smaller, equal mentioned in definition 47.
47:53
Yeah. Shouldn't it be should be greater than or equal to a cause?
48:03
No, because I mean, you are talking about a greater equal, a definition, and the definition is in its uses.
48:07
The relation are so there is no greater equal there. OK.
48:17
Can you explain what that bit in the bracket means, because I don't think I'm understanding the.
48:23
So this is a break at somewhere. No, no. You know, the B is related to a bit.
48:29
The implication, can you quickly explain that because I don't think I get that?
48:36
There has to be more precise because I don't understand what it is to be so, so, so so definition 477 we're looking at yes.
48:43
Yes. OK. So it's the first case is minimal? Yes.
48:51
And it says for all, be in a yes. If B is in a relation with with a safe B I.
48:56
That implies that B is equal to a B, equal to A because B is below R and R and A is minimal.
49:07
So we're just saying that anything that's below eight would just have to be cool because.
49:18
Yeah, yeah, so there's that. So in other words, there's nothing below a belt, a itself.
49:22
Oh, OK, I get that, no, thank you. OK. Sort of go back to a size where you want to do the exercise, of course.
49:29
Thank you. So I hope that I can update the file without destroying this vision.
49:43
So give me a shout. If you see this window disappearing, it disappears.
49:57
OK. Yeah, I was worried about that, so I need to.
50:03
OK, so. Well.
50:08
Good. I'm going to shop window so I can.
1:04:50
Go through the exercise, which you. Know we are good.
1:04:57
So the first part is relatively easy, and I need to show that the the condition decision Florida since 01 and is a control the.
1:05:18
And I do that by. Started with zero zero zero one, so I'm going to list the elements of this Cartesian product.
1:05:28
So I'm just going to do a walk through this through this diagram, so I'm going to go start here, start there, go down.
1:05:51
Go down. Down now.
1:06:01
So I'm walking through this. To this set it this way.
1:06:06
Yeah. So this is clearly subjective, it's a it's injected by the criterion that I have.
1:06:12
I only need to show that it is subjective. Yeah.
1:06:18
This is a. Such action.
1:06:25
From and to. Because that's the beauty of those three things to the fact that these are equivalent.
1:06:34
I don't need to show a lot more all than subject and I can show injection as well, but it's not needed.
1:06:46
OK, so now we start with the second part and I say, Well, that's a question, of course.
1:06:52
Yeah. So this is all we need to do, you know? Yeah, because it's like I said in the and the slides before,
1:06:59
you can sometimes write down the function officially, but it is about existing existence of objection.
1:07:05
And this diagram shows that objection exists, you haven't specified the objection which you have, you have shown that it exists.
1:07:14
Right. OK, thank you. Yeah, so in this case, a diagram will do.
1:07:23
But of course, if you make a mistake and you're right down, you're right down the list.
1:07:26
And so one of the exercises in the notes does that. Yeah. So the you need to be careful.
1:07:32
Yeah. So, OK, let's let's focus on number three there.
1:07:39
You know, so that's easiest. So if I look at three and I do the same thing there,
1:07:45
so it's assumed that X and Y are both infinitely large, then I can zero zero zero x one zero x two et etc.
1:07:50
And I have one y y zero lung y on.
1:08:05
Etc. Now, if you want to argue that this is an injection, for example, and this is going to be tough because you don't know if the.
1:08:15
No. Yeah.
1:08:30
You don't know if the if X and Y this sense have an empty intersection, so it might be that that certain elements are linked both to zero and one.
1:08:31
So this this construction is not as trustworthy in particular cases because you have to.
1:08:46
So this is you have to argue that the path that you're walking through here is the easiest sound path in the sense that all the paths I hit.
1:08:55
And there is no repetition in the past. This is not immediately clear for is now.
1:09:04
So this might be the solution for this problem is in steps.
1:09:10
And let me. Do this first.
1:09:16
Yeah. So first of all, there are four cases here.
1:09:25
Now, the first case is X and Y are both finite, and this is the thing that I that I highlighted before.
1:09:31
If you deal with compatibility, you have to deal with the cases that sets a fine.
1:09:41
So if they're both finite, then I'm doing this a bit quick now and it's x one.
1:09:46
So X zero to x and and why is y zero two y and an X Union Y is finite as well?
1:09:52
Yeah. So they have no elements in common, but that's not the issue.
1:10:06
The size of this is a natural number, which is and blossom. Now there's finance that as well.
1:10:20
So if X is finite. And why?
1:10:26
Is equivalent to end, then what you're building is so X is finite, so we have this particular case,
1:10:34
so we define the said x union y as x zero x and y zero y one, etc.
1:10:42
So this is an infinite list. Yeah. And of course, this is a mutual one.
1:10:58
This is my immature and plus one. So for entry, this is my image for emplacement and +2, et cetera.
1:11:04
No, so I can. But I can find very easily a function that is objection on this union.
1:11:13
The same case is where X is finite. And so why is find it an is equivalent to end this very similar and then the final part is the.
1:11:22
Some of the most is not as passive.
1:11:45
So now I have both X and Y. So I have say X is equivalent to end and Y is equivalent to answers my last case,
1:11:56
so this is case number two is case number three, this case and before.
1:12:12
So now I have that the union of these two sets and I know.
1:12:18
So the union of these two sets is I can write this as so x union y.
1:12:29
I can write as. So this is equivalent to zero zero zero x one.
1:12:38
Etc. infinite list. And I have two zero y on my zero zero.
1:12:56
My mom. Now I can use this as a as the idea for my for my by injection.
1:13:04
And the so what I'm going to build is a function from and to actually.
1:13:24
From 00:01 times and two ex union, why so this is not the union, just to say a mental aid.
1:13:35
I'm going to use what I'm going to do here and go and say, OK, f of zero.
1:13:46
And that is so this dysfunction here.
1:13:53
This is established to the function G. And this is a deficit of function h introduced by ejection from Exeter and an AC projection.
1:13:58
All right. And so I define F of zero and as h, there should be inverse of n not so G.
1:14:07
And I define f of long and to be h inverse of n no.
1:14:24
We're sort of. Where did you get the edge? But where do I get the watery edge in the last line?
1:14:40
The edge, yeah. Yeah. You wrote. Always my last edge.
1:14:48
Alright. OK. So this is the projection between Ryan and Jesus projecting between action and would have been better,
1:14:53
had a rhythm it and the other way around like, let me do this slightly, slightly better notation.
1:15:01
Come on, give me the eraser that. No, so I have here that gee, from and to X and h from and to Y objections.
1:15:10
Yeah. So these are both infinite and uncountable, so this protection exists.
1:15:33
And what I do here is, I think, the inverse of that.
1:15:40
OK, so now F0 zero and it's the JioTV and everyone, and it's the age of an.
1:15:45
OK, so this is a subjective function. Now.
1:15:51
The. All the elements in X are hit by all the elements in Y, hit by H and D because they have an empty intersection,
1:16:02
it is impossible that the elements so an element will be held from two different directions.
1:16:18
So this is also an injection. Now, so because all the elements starting all the power, starting with zero metal tanks,
1:16:27
all the power started with one and went onto why they have no intersection.
1:16:38
So this function is both subjective and injunctive. Yeah, and some sort of consciousness question.
1:16:42
So do we need to link the. So basically the last two lines zero end mapping of zero end on one end to the
1:16:51
previous proof and parts of one zero times or like Cartesian products of of nature.
1:17:00
No, like how do you know?
1:17:07
So I am not yet at the level of accountability.
1:17:11
Yeah, I mean, I could go to the definitions that I have seen and actually I have it now, but I'll do that at the end.
1:17:15
But what I want to do is to come back to. To come back to.
1:17:22
The point one there and used there to argue to the accountability of what I'm doing now, I'm officially, I'm not there yet.
1:17:33
No, I don't think that's established that effort by Jackson between this here, the cottage in public there and the union.
1:17:42
OK. Right. So you're going to show us later. Yeah.
1:17:50
So now I can, I can. So this is my stance. So I know that.
1:17:54
OK, so from part one.
1:17:59
Yeah. So this is we know. That there exists.
1:18:05
A function came from and to. So wrong times, and it is A.
1:18:20
Now we know this function exists, and now we define.
1:18:32
And let's call this function B and B works from and to ex-union, why?
1:18:40
I b is a f after gay.
1:18:48
Now, so this is a we have every objection we had that piece is just so the official, the gays objection.
1:18:57
And so the composition of those two is as objection as well as five objection from and to the union.
1:19:06
That's why so. X, you knew why this can't.
1:19:12
And could you explain, like, you know, in the like square bracket that you have with, you know,
1:19:24
this this is this is a for me in aid in what I've been trying to do and the proof I basically want to represent this union like this.
1:19:32
But of course, this is not the union. Yeah.
1:19:43
So if I if I list all the elements in X separately from all the elements in why in a diagram, I would do it like this.
1:19:46
But when I say little a label that it goes.
1:19:54
So this is, by the way, it is nonsense. Thank you for doing my thing to do that because this would be on there.
1:19:58
OK, yeah, I was just a bit confused about what? Yeah. So it's OK.
1:20:05
So in short, Ignore said heads was just an aide for myself.
1:20:09
Good. So know that. Wait a second. So too, is Tony to say it's both subtraction and injection, so we can say it's OK.
1:20:14
How I just say it's rejection and by all, I'm coming back to that.
1:20:24
I'm going back to that. I just want to do the first, the formal bath, and then I'm going to use to the actual properties that I that are listed.
1:20:29
OK, yeah, we used to just use the property outside to do that.
1:20:38
We can transfer X Union Y to be something like X Union Y without X so we can sit next to the next in the.
1:20:44
Yeah, so that's part number three. Yeah. So in part, number three, I uh.
1:20:55
Yeah. So it's a third party and I don't need to prove this is an arbitrary union.
1:21:03
Yeah. So it is no longer demands that they are disjoint.
1:21:08
Yeah. So for the four part number three, as you suggested, we say that right x you and Y as x union y without x.
1:21:12
Yeah. So there's this joint. OK, now the this is a subset of Y.
1:21:31
And the subset of accountable set is accountable sent. Yeah.
1:21:41
This you can do to throw the fact that we have a an injection site, identities and injection on on this set.
1:21:45
Yeah. So it's an injection into a kind of percent and.
1:21:54
So identity on why is injection from why without access to why?
1:22:00
So I have an injection there so these subsidies can double as well.
1:22:18
And so I have to control sets X and Y without X, both countable and disjoint.
1:22:24
So by my two, this is now by two x.
1:22:31
And then why without access is countable.
1:22:38
And I know that ex-union, why is exactly that said, you know, it's the same set in our right, it doesn't change the accountability, you know?
1:22:46
So this is going to well. OK, so here we have used the already dilemma if and I'll go back and look at the criteria that I had.
1:22:55
So if there was just a suggestion from if form accountable to the set that I want, then I'm happy.
1:23:04
So in this particular case here,
1:23:11
I already know that if if I can argue this is God the ball and this is of because I have a subjective function that you know,
1:23:14
so using these criteria, I can actually shorten the proof. Now, so and for the first one and as well, so the fact that all the past.
1:23:25
So I need now, so here all I need to study,
1:23:38
there's this objection and that is enough because I'm mapping a accountable Senate wishes and onto dissent and if such action is not done now.
1:23:42
So using the criteria that I mentioned, these things get a little bit easier.
1:23:54
So could you could you explain the third question? The first method again, not the second.
1:24:00
The first one. I've only given one method here,
1:24:05
so the thing that I've written here on the right is to argue that Y is accountable if Y without X is accountable, sent a wise, accountable set.
1:24:13
I'm talking about the one about the part about this. I know, but I just talk about this here.
1:24:25
No, the one above this one above, OK, so the one way you define it, the swamp of it is Question two is now question three.
1:24:33
It's a sort of conditional question to. So you joined or confusing me?
1:24:43
So what is your question about this is the body's definition there? Yeah, could you could you just explain this part of the question again?
1:24:50
So I'm mapping, so I have already established that this is countable of.
1:24:58
Yeah. If I can find the subjective or objection from Uganda said onto another set, then that's kind of a set as well.
1:25:03
Now, so the Indian, in the end, I need to find as a function for natural numbers to to set and dealing with, which is objection.
1:25:11
Yeah. So that's the thing that I'm really interested in. So here I'm using a vehicle in between.
1:25:20
I say, well, I take the function from zero one to end and I'm going to method so to function.
1:25:27
I'm going to map on to the union by saying that if the bear starts with the zero, then I apply the objection that I get from here.
1:25:33
So I know that this section exists because I know that X is countable and infinite.
1:25:45
I didn't know that this projection exists because I know that y is countable infinite.
1:25:52
So I, using G and age, start to define F.
1:25:57
So it is so dysfunctional and building from zero one times and until the Union of Action by it,
1:26:05
that is a subjective function because if it's subjective on X and so Jesus or the trajectory of on x and H's subjective on way.
1:26:11
So this combination is subjective and x union y.
1:26:21
It is injected because there are no elements in common X and Y ciano elements.
1:26:26
So it is impossible for a zero K and a No.
1:26:32
One else to map on the same element. You will be there.
1:26:36
Yeah. OK, good. So let me go back to the slides because it's different, like I just asked no questions.
1:26:46
Well? Yeah, go ahead.
1:26:54
Can you explain the the question to the part where you have won comfortable sets on one sort of one finite, comfortable on one infinite consequence?
1:26:56
Yeah. So it's it's it's it's infinite, accountable or finite.
1:27:07
Yeah. So let's use that terminology. So the case is so if what I need to do is I need to find a bite section from from end to to the set.
1:27:12
Well, should section if you like. And so I'm building into suggestion by saying, OK, I have a final set in an infinite set.
1:27:23
I first list all the elements in the finite said that will stop and analysed all the elements in the infinite set.
1:27:30
Oh, right, okay, so you can't do this. So, so here I am, I'm first listing X, that's the final said.
1:27:41
And then I lost all the ice and it's an infinite set. Right, OK.
1:27:47
OK. And of course, the action y was flip and and it's similar.
1:27:53
Good. This was an exam question, by the way, a couple of years ago.
1:28:01
So let me go back to the to the slides. We have a very little time left and we have some very interesting little properties to correct.
1:28:06
Gone, things go, never stop.
1:28:19
Hmm. Oh, no, that's the wrong one, so I.
1:28:25
Yes. OK, good. So we were there.
1:28:37
So and to illustrate Contos construction, it's often used as a dynamic organisation argument.
1:28:43
OK, so this is a visualisation of Qantas prove it's not a different proof.
1:28:55
It is exactly the same thing.
1:29:01
It's just it shows you how it works in, for example, the case that you are dealing with, isn't it for the freelance said.
1:29:02
So the point is the following you try to.
1:29:10
I tried to get your keyboard to work, and it takes a few seconds.
1:29:17
I hate to go.
1:29:22
So I is I see is trying to catch up with me.
1:29:33
Yeah. So. So what we do is we are going to represent a subset of natural numbers by a list of ones and zeros.
1:29:37
And so we are writing a zero if in position and if any is not in the subset and we write a one in position and if an is an element of the subset.
1:29:48
So every subset gets represented by a list of zeros and ones.
1:30:06
So now I'm assuming that the Powerset is countable.
1:30:11
And then, of course, I will go to the conclusion that it is not countable. So this is a perfectly allowed proof in our, you know, definition.
1:30:15
Yeah. So we are going to assume that the that is countable so I can list all the
1:30:24
subsets that my assumption and I'm going to show that if I tried to do that,
1:30:31
I can find this said that is not in the list.
1:30:36
No matter how I define my list, I can define something that's not in the list and which is essentially going to be just said, be that count defined.
1:30:39
Yeah. So if I take that infinite list of sets, then I'm defining a new set w by saying, well, zero is in W.
1:30:48
If zero is not in V0 and one is in the in in W, if one is not in one, that's it.
1:31:01
Yeah. So there is an if and only if relation. I only put an element in V W if the corresponding.
1:31:16
So this position and I'm good in putting N in W if N is not an element of V and OK because I do it like this.
1:31:24
Yeah. And so I put it in there, if it's not in there and if it's if if N is not in V and then I'm not putting and you know,
1:31:34
so this is the way you u constructed set,
1:31:43
then this is clearly a subset of N and it is different from all the viz because en position and it is different for V and.
1:31:47
So this is a said that is not in the list now.
1:31:57
And you can do this in in in the diagram. You can say, well, OK, a list, all the sets, so have all the zeros and ones there.
1:32:01
I look at the diagonal and I'm creating V W to be different on the diagonal.
1:32:11
So all the dagdag opposition, I'll take a different position then,
1:32:18
so I create a set in an infinite way that is not in this infinite list guaranteed now.
1:32:22
So this is called the diagnostician argument. So this is a technique that you that you might be you won't want to apply.
1:32:30
So for example, if I ask you to check if it sets countable or not, if you think it's countable,
1:32:38
you have to produce a objection or a suggestion of an injection, depending on how you are your reason.
1:32:45
But if you want to show that it is not countable, you have to do a construction like this,
1:32:54
or you show that it is equivalent to a set that we already know is not countable.
1:32:59
Like, for example, the rules. Yeah, but a diagnosis, an argument that is the generic tool or showing that a set is not countable.
1:33:04
Good. We've got time, we have we have time, OK.
1:33:15
Yeah, so this administration argument, and I hope you see that what it does here,
1:33:23
so it picks an element such that and is not an element of Pennsylvania.
1:33:28
Now, so that's the exactly what the tribe said. So it follows Qantas construction, what it does is Doug musician argument.
1:33:36
Good, the last thing that I want to discuss with you is the the fact that there are massive differences in in infinity.
1:33:46
Yeah. So you can argue that the for example of the proof that the the the power set
1:33:55
of end is not countable is what I say is for every list that you produce,
1:34:03
I will find an element that is not in the list. So that would give you the sensation that you are missing it, but just a little bit,
1:34:09
you know that the next level of infinity up is only a little bit more.
1:34:16
No. So I'm going to show now is that the next level of infinity up is colossal is absolutely massive.
1:34:21
So remember that the original numbers that's that's accountable said.
1:34:31
The set of rules is the I've not shown it, but I've said it.
1:34:36
That's equivalent to the do the power set of end. So this basically looks at the difference of the infinity,
1:34:41
the first step in the infinity hierarchy between natural numbers and the power set of natural numbers.
1:34:47
OK, good. Bear with me. It's a tricky construction, but once you understand how it works, it's very nice.
1:34:52
So we know that queue is an infinite, countable set and therefore I can list all the rational numbers.
1:35:00
Yeah, so I built at least a few zero one. That's it.
1:35:08
Well, that's a given. I know this list exist, and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to define a subset of on that contains queue,
1:35:13
which I can measure so I can give a measure to. And what I do is around each element in queue.
1:35:21
I counted at casted interval. So this fee I cast around Q I and it has sized Delta now to Delta, actually.
1:35:30
But it's it's a v delta almost that defined well as an interval.
1:35:41
And if you remember, I hope you remember this from school, something we haven't discussed at all.
1:35:45
Yeah. So intervals around numbers, that's a sort. It's a set with a beginning and an end, and all the elements in between are in that in that set.
1:35:50
Yeah. So this is a subset of R. It starts at Q.
1:35:59
Mine is still the times through the mind's eye and it stops at Q plus delta times to the mind's eye.
1:36:06
Yeah. And I can define the said v delta, which is the union of all these bits.
1:36:13
So I take them all together and I do the infinite union over all the atoms in Q, I joined them.
1:36:20
So Q. Each QB sits inside his interval, right to strike in the middle.
1:36:28
So cue is a subset of this set.
1:36:34
No, it is a set that is inside them. OK, the length of each fly with Delta.
1:36:39
Is exactly two times Delta, times to the mind's eye.
1:36:48
Know this is no there. So the size of this particular set, there is exactly this number.
1:36:53
So you can measure the length, it's an interval, it has a length now,
1:37:01
so if we do find that length as as this, so does a normal rotation just represents the size of the set.
1:37:06
OK, then we can make the following observation that zero is smaller than the sum of all these numbers because each number is greater than zero,
1:37:13
that has more than one element. It's a full length and and the sum of all these lengths is exactly the sum that I've written down.
1:37:26
So from I from zero to infinity of two to the minus five plus one times Delta, which is four times don't know.
1:37:38
So this implies that Q sits inside the said v delta, which sits in an interval that has length for Delta.
1:37:46
Which is not infinity. You know, this is this is this is the finite length, so you can put all of cue inside a finite length inside.
1:37:58
Ah, so that's remarkable already. But what's more remarkable is that we can now limit.
1:38:10
We can make delta small as we like, so we can take the limit of the delta to zero for four v delta.
1:38:19
And I call that the said fee. Now this is this is a set.
1:38:26
So v then because it has size four Delta with Delta going to zero, the set of fee and the limit becomes zero.
1:38:33
Now in this golden Knoll said now one of the few things that made sense that made it into the is The Big Bang Theory.
1:38:42
So this is an all set. This is said that can be ignored inside.
1:38:54
It has no measure. It has no presence. It has no significance now.
1:38:58
But we know also the accused inside this subset of V. So Q is a subset of our that is a null set as well.
1:39:03
So that means that all the rationales inside are they they they mean nothing.
1:39:12
Yeah. Although you could say well in between to rationalise this, it's a real and in-between to a real sense, it's rational.
1:39:19
The the the the measure of infinity is colossally different inside the rules.
1:39:26
Q is non-existent. It is. It is a zero percent it has.
1:39:33
So you can take Q out without affecting the the real line.
1:39:38
It makes no sense. So this means that he did so and this is the one level of step in terms of infinity.
1:39:45
So we understand the infinity event of Q, which is the infinity event,
1:39:55
and we think we understand the affinity of R because that's the infinity of the powers that event.
1:39:59
But this example shows that it is an explosion. It is.
1:40:05
It's a fast fast. It is absolutely insane how big the jump in infinity is from descent to the next.
1:40:08
And of course, if you go to the polls, say that about that event, you have another one of these colossal explosions.
1:40:19
OK, so what is the consequence of this in terms of computer science is that you don't
1:40:25
have an effective way of representing the reals because it is just too many.
1:40:31
You know, it's such a large centre that you can't you cannot hope to to represent them.
1:40:36
So that's why you have to do the definition of rules as a as a two no representation,
1:40:42
you have to the exponent and you have the mentors, I think it's called.
1:40:50
And so calculations inside the computer with rules is very, very tricky.
1:40:55
Calculations would admissions over natural numbers is very straightforward.
1:41:01
So you can do that even to infinite precision. But with rules, it's it becomes very, very tricky.
1:41:05
You can't really do that. Is this construction clear?
1:41:11
I have another another couple of minutes, yeah, we have it in the ten minutes I can I can try and do this again.
1:41:24
Yeah. So the idea is you look at all the rational numbers on the real line and around each rational number.
1:41:30
You got it. You cut out the little interval and you say, OK, that's that's the bit I'm going to take out of the reals.
1:41:40
And you do that for all the rest. You'll know which you've got, but you got it in such a way that the size is shrinking of the thing that you cut out.
1:41:47
You got it. The size is shrinking in such a way that the total amount of stuff that you cut out is is a finite amount.
1:41:55
Now it's for Delta. So you can take, for example, Delta to be one now and then this construction says that queue sits in a set that has size for.
1:42:03
And you can take the other half, and it is still in the death and quarter size one,
1:42:20
so you can Delta made Delta small as you like all the time that you make Delta smaller, you actually physically cutting out pieces, you know?
1:42:25
But in the limit, you're cutting out nothing. Now, but you are removing Cuba.
1:42:35
Tokyo gets removed and the limit with which you remove is nothing.
1:42:42
This has no science and signals. Good.
1:42:47
Yeah. So queues and all in and so this means that the court inanity of the reals who just got an entity of the Post,
1:42:58
that event is vastly greater than the current queue, which is calling at the event.
1:43:06
So this is incomparable. And so in the end, the big conundrum in mathematics is,
1:43:12
is this something inside in between these two because this is of enormous jump in complexity and infinity?
1:43:18
So, yeah, so so far, nobody's ever been able to answer the the content hypothesis.
1:43:26
We think there is no level of infinity in between.
1:43:33
We we had no idea. We can't prove it. That's it.
1:43:37
Good, assume there are no questions, let me thank you very much, I see all your clapping hands, that's lovely.
1:43:52
Lovely to see. So the thing is to come back to some practical things.
1:43:59
So you have still a P.A. which you have to hand in next week.
1:44:05
The the logic will start on Tuesday, and that's a good thing.
1:44:10
The day will link to parts that I've discussed, so they will come back to to formula and improving,
1:44:17
but it will be more focussed on the structure of the prove rather than what you prove.
1:44:25
So it's it's a different angle to the same problem.
1:44:30
We will come up with an assess coursework for the schools, which will be the coursework component for the exam mock.
1:44:34
And we will need to synchronise with the people who do the logic to how we exactly organise this.
1:44:42
But at the moment, we are thinking about having the coursework that you do at home.
1:44:51
So no time constraint and you can you hand it in and then that will be marked and that constitute the course of a coupon, but it hasn't decided yet.
1:44:57
The the will be an exam in May,
1:45:08
and I am more than happy to have a Q&A session in the weeks before the exam somewhere to go over any kind of question you might have.
1:45:12
I will release the the the answers to all the exercises in the in the notes after next Thursday.
1:45:22
So after you've handed in the the last P.A. work, so you will have ample time to revise everything before the exams takes place.
1:45:32
OK. So if there is no further issue to discuss, I have now closed the close to recording.
1:45:46
We wouldn't do the exam in me. It's the timetable it needs to come out and it's normally in mind somewhere that a timetable comes out, right?
1:45:57
OK.
1:46:08
