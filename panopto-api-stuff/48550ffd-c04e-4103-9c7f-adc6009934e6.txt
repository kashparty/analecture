Title: Amadeus ACI talk Oct 21
Category: Applications of Computing in Industry (ACI) Talks
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 19/10/2021
Excellent. There we go. Welcome, everybody.
0:03
We're delighted to have with us Patrick and Julian from Amadeus, which is one of those companies that you may never have heard about.
0:06
But once you've heard about them and realised what they do, you start to see their activities everywhere.
0:16
There are actually major players in the in the travel industry, and you've probably all used the services many, many times.
0:23
And they can tell us about the impact of the pandemic on the travel industry.
0:32
Some show the pandemic has affected almost everyone, but no one more severely,
0:37
I guess, than those working in the US and using the services of the travel industry.
0:43
So please take it away. We're really interested to hear more about this.
0:50
Thank you. And so I'll start by introducing myself,
0:55
so I'm working for a since 2010 and currently working as a senior manager for the customer management application.
1:01
And as you rightly said, it's not a medication known to the to the public, but it's widely used at airports to pose passengers.
1:12
So that's what airline agents are using to process your baggage.
1:25
You're checking and boarding the plane. Everything is managed through this this application.
1:29
And my colleague Patrick, who used to work on the same application before and move to to another one as well,
1:35
in the same way as for a few years I've worked on the departure control system.
1:41
And on top of what Julia mentioned, that also works on our weight and balance application,
1:48
which is a very interesting one that allows airlines to manage the weight of the aircraft
1:53
to decide how to load the cargo and balance based on where the passengers are seated,
2:01
how to manage fuel and so on. So this was a good, good part of my work experience.
2:06
And for the last five years, I've moved more on the data side of things, working on the on the data platform that we call Dynamic Intelligence Hub,
2:12
which is a platform that allows our airline customers to manipulate the data,
2:22
in particular the real time and operational data, but also bridging with big data capabilities.
2:28
And more recently, I'm involved now into what we as an idea want to do in the industry by creating what we
2:37
call a data space or a space where several companies in the travel can exchange data.
2:48
And it's something that is happening in other verticals and driven by Europe.
2:55
So we are playing a big role in it. So that's when my background in a nutshell.
3:03
And if we move on and tell you a little bit about Amadeus,
3:12
so this is a technology company and we are dedicated to the world of work, to the travel travel industry.
3:18
We offer cutting edge solutions that help key players in the travel industry to
3:28
succeed in their business and all together to shape how travel is moving forward.
3:34
We are truly global company. We have offices in many countries.
3:43
And so instead of boring you with a lot of figures, we're going to go through a very short video that will give you an idea of what we do.
3:48
And. OK, so there's been a few hiccups with the sound,
4:41
but hopefully you have got now a good idea of of what we do and the type of
5:45
volumes and the presence worldwide that we we have to be on as a travel industry.
5:51
The beautiful entreats moving a lot.
5:57
It's touching things that are very concrete for all of us that are helping with our day to day and to ease of all travel around the world.
6:00
But this industry obviously changed a lot.
6:11
If we can move to the next and you all know why you changed a lot.
6:16
It changed a lot with with covid. So covid has completely disrupted our lives for all of us.
6:21
And, of course, the travel industry with that and with Lockdown's aircraft have been stranded on the ground for months.
6:29
And this is a situation that's the aviation and civil aviation wasn't ready to deal with from all angles,
6:38
including a parking infrastructure and so on.
6:46
In the same way, the hospitality side, as we are also working on hospitality and providing solutions for hotel.
6:53
Most hotel had to close or reduced dramatically their capacity, either because of the demand was low or because of local restrictions.
7:00
So in just a few weeks, something quite incredible happened in our industry and also the workforce and the entire industry has shrunk massively.
7:11
So I will I will hand over to will tell you a bit more about the impact and and what we are doing as a company to ease the travel back to normal,
7:22
standdown. Everything to you.
7:34
Thanks, Patrick. And I just want to stress out it's quite funny how it turned out that that a guy doesn't
7:37
want to talk about daytime's that plays a video and leaves me to to present the figures.
7:45
But yes, so we have to try to represent the impact it had on the industry.
7:50
We wanted to show you a few figures so you can see the big drop in incapacities, the number of seats available to travel around the world.
7:59
And we see Asia, of course, dropped earlier than January, February of twenty twenty, whereas all the other regions waited until the end of March.
8:13
And then after Asia started to resume a bit sooner than others, the US never closed.
8:27
So that's why it's also higher than the rest of Europe had a bit of ups and downs depending
8:35
on the different restrictions and lockdown's that were put in place by the authorities.
8:43
But overall, we see that the trend is going upwards.
8:50
And if we are still with a capacity that's way below what we had in 2019 and the offering from airlines is going up now,
8:55
I want you to show also the and the demands of actual passenger flying during this period.
9:09
So the green curve is twenty nineteen.
9:18
So that gives us a comparison to you can see some seasonal changes, like more people travelling over the summer and and less over the winter.
9:22
And if we see the same, so the actual number of passenger drops to the ground in in April and then went back up and down,
9:32
depending again on the and different ways of slowdown and travel restrictions and the Delta volumes.
9:44
You can see it's all across the the the coast where we are at at the moment is the figures are based in June
9:54
because it comes from an international organism that's the ICAO is giving us figures that they have a bit of a lag.
10:06
So if we look at that September, we are a bit higher than this.
10:15
We've passed the 50 percent margin compared to twenty nineteen.
10:20
And the travel is mostly domestic, but we see that international travel in blue is picking up as well.
10:24
Now, this sets a new problem for for airlines.
10:32
And this is how to resume activities when.
10:36
There are so many new rules that are put in place by governments and the airlines to enforce those rules on their behalf.
10:41
So the answer that they was providing for that's, um, is this a project I'm going to agree to?
10:50
And then I will try to walk you through the new travel agency.
11:00
So when you take an aeroplane for your next vacation and you can imagine,
11:07
you will have to first get informed on the status of the different countries to decide where you want to go.
11:15
So we have a partner that gets the data from all across the world and we can display that to a traveller in their search experience.
11:24
Once you've decided on a destination, will you have to book?
11:36
So you have to provide maybe a vaccine certificate or at the time of booking and you'll be reminded that's OK,
11:41
these are the travel restrictions in place, what you need to do during your flight on arrival and what kind of documents you need to carry with you.
11:55
And when you are closer to the departure, you will have, of course,
12:07
are the ones still to verify your status, making sure that you are not bringing lines of covid with you.
12:12
So that's where we have this and this new application to travel, if you follow, which is.
12:22
Actually embedded into an airline websites,
12:31
so you have just a new a new tie like this on the airline websites where you can send your covid-19 test results on
12:36
vaccin sets or anything that that is required in advance so that you don't have to queue at the airports to do that.
12:47
Obviously, this is the last thing you want to learn to do.
12:56
And so we are able to capture and validate automatically the proof of travel.
13:00
And there are different methods for that.
13:08
You can scan QR codes, for example, is the NHS through our code on the digital covid certificate, QR codes and many others have done this as well.
13:11
And we have Optical Cochiti Commission when there's no QR code and you just need to scan the documents,
13:25
the paper documents you've been provided by authorities or in the lab you get tested at.
13:32
So this we saw in some of the photos we integrate with with partners, I mentioned the EU digital certificates, but they are not the only one.
13:40
They are all the partners. The market is very fragmented that.
13:51
Everyone is rushing to try to help the restart of trouble.
13:56
So now I want to I mean, give a few words about the architecture, and so I mentioned before the customer management application.
14:03
So that's the application that this and this backend is sitting on top of.
14:13
And we have the airline checking here on the lefts.
14:22
All application is a Web component that integrates listening to this font and communicates with rest APIs with all backend, which is built in Python.
14:30
So it's an example of what goes on when we have the QR code scan.
14:41
So you see, for instance, all the ages up and we, of course,
14:46
deal with all data with the highest level of of security and compliance with all the data protection acts across the world.
14:52
And because we have very sensitive data, we are used to manipulate critical data.
15:04
It's the first time format that we are manipulating has data.
15:10
So then this barcode, when you scanned it, will be paired with one of the cloud providers and the idea might start on you or NHS systems.
15:15
We will get in touch with the system.
15:28
They did could then once we have the information decoded from the geocode thanks to their participation, we will compare that to a set of rules.
15:30
So we are not maintaining ourselves or our customers. We do not ask them to maintain themselves the rules between each country.
15:41
That is, as you can imagine, and the immense complexity with with that.
15:49
So is a third party the difference between industrial relations breaking with which the risk line
15:55
that gets all the data from the different states and the dates that the database for us to to use.
16:03
And once this is done, we mark the customer record, OK, to fit.
16:13
To fly. Another example with a paper document that is kind of floated in this case, we need first to extract information from the documents.
16:18
So we use optical character, the commission, as I mentioned,
16:30
we leveraged our partnership with Microsoft Azure and use some of their managed services to accomplish that.
16:35
We set the threshold of 90 percent confidence for the reading part of the document.
16:44
And then we have different flows to if we are not. Above this confidence factor will enter the back office floor where we send information by email.
16:51
We will soon have a UI provided to agents in call centres that they can deal with the Zuckermann themselves,
17:04
because our policy, our technology is not perfect. It's still, of course, work in progress.
17:12
And the occasions where we will not be able to read the document. You have to think that, for example, the US vaccine certificates,
17:19
since in the US they do not want to have the same system we have with the NHS and everyone having digital proof of vaccination.
17:29
It's paper cards that are signed and then the vaccine itself,
17:40
the name of the vaccine is handwritten by the health professional who did the vaccination.
17:48
So yeah, this situation we we are not getting always and the information extracted correctly from the OCA,
17:54
but in case we are confident enough with our extraction, then we do the same process.
18:03
And so before we compare, we get what are the rules applicable for this trip and compare the results with guts.
18:08
And then if this check is successful, a data customer record.
18:18
So that will enable agents at the airport to let the passengers that are already.
18:24
Vetted by the solution to go through without further checks, so that's the big help for the agents.
18:33
And and. Now I have a quote from a young one of the developer who worked on on the up.
18:41
And he was very enthusiastic about this because he's an alumni from from Imbil.
18:50
And so he put a lot of things. What I take away from this is that's.
18:57
He's very happy to to work on his projects and his contribution was really defining and the architecture and you laid
19:06
the groundwork for the need for the service part of this so that we are interacting with lots of excellent partners.
19:17
So that was a very critical part of the software and now is following the project from an architects point of view.
19:24
So getting pulled in whenever there's a technical decision or discussion and a meeting is its recommendations and its take away
19:31
of this is that really makes him happy to to enable people to go and see their families and to travel and to get a nice break.
19:42
You also insisted. So I've asked him for a picture and he insisted to give me this one as well.
19:57
So, yeah, I am following the architect's recommendation,
20:03
and that's I'm on the ski trip with colleagues from from ideas and just to lead you on final words on this project.
20:08
So we started developments in February this year.
20:18
We had the first one live with minimal version of what I described before in April and in October.
20:22
We have 13 airlines still using the solution and the eight all the airlines at our interests waiting to activate in production.
20:31
So development is still going full speed ahead. And we had more and more features as the travel restrictions evolve.
20:39
And to give you an example, at the start it was only about test results.
20:48
Then we had the vaccine. Then we as the passenger locator forms, all of these keeps on coming and changing.
20:54
It's very dynamic, as you can imagine. And we are still working a lot on this and a political solution as far as we go.
21:03
And three weeks ago, we passed the mark of a one million passenger verified and we can see all monitoring in production from the end of September.
21:11
That's steadily increasing with the traffic restarting.
21:22
And whenever we have a new airline joining this project, I back to you, I think.
21:26
Thank you, John. And indeed, your team is amongst those that have done a great job to adapt to react quickly and provide quick solution out there.
21:34
Before we we open the floor for questions, I will let you read as we wanted to give you as you as well of what's them.
21:45
But it was always the opportunities that are in Amadou's. So I let you read the other two main benefits.
21:55
The one thing that I would like to mention is really the people side,
22:02
everybody who has ever put food in them, they will confirm that the atmosphere is quite amazing.
22:11
There was a lot of brilliant minds who have the freedom to explore and be creative, but more importantly, who are I mean, providing support.
22:19
And there's like a it's like a big family with a lot of support to on each other.
22:30
We do have brilliant solutions that are recognised as as market leader.
22:37
But to be honest, my personal view and I think is shared by many people are real asset is our people.
22:42
There's no doubt about that. If you move to things like Julia in particular to on on graduate and internships.
22:49
So we have opportunities. We have a real graduate programme.
23:01
It's a two year programme that is quite well structured with a mentor.
23:06
We like reviews regularly during the year and that is a real plus and and helps
23:13
every graduate that joins somebody who's normally has a really good experience.
23:22
Or if you're interested here, please feel free to either go on on our website, look at opportunities,
23:29
or drop Julia or myself an email, our email address on the on the slide at the beginning.
23:37
And we'll be more than happy to to support and to share opportunities with you.
23:43
And that closes our session. Thank you.
23:50
Thanks very much, Patrick. And very interesting, insightful presentation.
23:54
Does anyone have. Questions. Maybe what people are thinking of question, I've got one I was burning to ostracise, so before the pandemic, I mean,
24:00
I remember visiting Amadeus and talking to staff and there was this sense that the
24:14
travel industry kind of in terms of the technology deployed in the way people travel,
24:22
it was quite slow to make changes. Right.
24:28
And you had to, for example, cater to the lowest common denominator when it came to,
24:32
for example, the technology that you could expect to find in an airport anywhere in the world.
24:37
Right. Has that changed with the pandemic?
24:42
Have airlines become more focussed on upgrading their technology and being a bit more agile with the rate at which they adopt changes in innovation?
24:45
I will start and let you compliment that, that there is there is a lot that we are driving actually, you know,
24:59
they ways to adapt our technology and be able to be more agile and more adopting develops,
25:06
adopting plenty of technology that allows us to provide a solution that will move quicker.
25:13
And actually, what I explain is a good example of our industry moving quickly and adapting quickly to a situation.
25:20
There is one thing because you, William, you mention airport that that remains.
25:30
And it's the fact that we address customers and touch points which are all over the world.
25:35
We would like deployed in very specific infrastructure and very UNICOR infrastructure.
25:43
You can imagine that means and and what you can do in an airport like Heathrow is not the same as what you can do in
25:53
a very tiny airport lost in the countryside where we are connectivity and bandwidth and so on will be very limited.
26:01
And also the physical work stations are quite limited.
26:11
So that's something that we as an industry we need to deal with and that will take time to change and adapt.
26:15
That said, there's plenty of work happening in the travel industry to evolve and really
26:25
embrace the digitalisation of the sort of more of a merchandising mindset.
26:32
And so we we now work on our offer and order and offer a platform which will be the next generation of of travel solutions, which are more in line,
26:42
that which basically will simplify the industry, simplify the fact that we we come from a world where you had a paper ticket not so long ago.
26:58
And and. Yeah, and that's that's now evolving quite a lot.
27:08
And I think the year where covid and the PennyMac might help actually is by focussing on simplifying the industry
27:14
and and getting rid of a lot of the complexity that has been accumulated in our industry over the years.
27:25
Great. She went on to say, yeah, in politics, and so was quite exhausted.
27:36
I think maybe the only thing I would add more from my departure control system, HUTZ is an.
27:44
We said and the news is not known to the public. The only situation where we can be known is if we fail, because that will be noticed immediately.
27:56
And you might remember a couple of years ago, there was a meltdown.
28:07
The system and all passengers were stuck at the airports in the news every hour.
28:14
That wasn't Amadou's. But this kind of things is is a risk for us, of course.
28:20
And in our position, we are trying to have a very robust, quality control.
28:27
And this is also a balance we have to strike between the speed of delivery and the stability of our system.
28:33
So it's something that is very important for us and that that we are very passionate about inequality.
28:44
Now with these projects.
28:56
The second project I mentioned and even though we the same education we tried to limit as much as possible to the Times with the application.
28:58
So that's if this part fails, it doesn't endanger the rest.
29:08
So we've isolated it. And we thanks to this,
29:12
we were able to and to go at a very fast pace and still not neglecting quality
29:16
bits and the same having a delivery that's faster than our usual projects.
29:24
Shorter cycle. Yes, shorter cycles. Great.
29:33
OK, thanks very much. We've got some questions now from the audience.
29:37
So just a follow on to the one that I asked.
29:43
Josh asks, Do you think some elements of this system will remain in place after covid or once airlines return to normal?
29:46
And will Amadiya still be playing a major role? Some good question, the short answer is, I don't know, the slightly less short answer is,
29:54
I believe and our product managements believe as well that this we will stay in the current form,
30:09
but simply stay and evolve,
30:21
because at the moment it was the urgency of covid governments knew they did not have the capacity and the capabilities to implement this.
30:22
Kobie checks themselves. So they put the burden on the airlines and the industry to say, you have to check the health status of your passengers.
30:34
So that was a temporary measure. Now we know covid is a big band.
30:45
We know that. And the day we continue, it's not something that that was one of them will not happen again for the next hundreds of years.
30:50
It will it will happen again. We don't know how much on which magnitude, which stated we need it to happen again.
31:00
So what I believe and what our strategy is, is that.
31:08
This is what we're building now, will be used by governments later.
31:14
So instead of interacting with different partners and all,
31:18
we interact directly with governments and it will be used as a tool to contain the next pandemic.
31:22
Ed and Tucumn, father, I think one of the very important elements in that question is return to normal.
31:32
And I think that that's that's a key part of your question is what normal?
31:40
What normally if we if we make a parallel in to war and that may be a bit philosophical,
31:46
but make a parallel to the way we all work nowadays and the way most companies are adapted into offering remote working and so on,
31:53
are we ever going to go back into a world where you will be asked to be five days a week?
32:04
Sitting in an office, probably not, and most companies are going to announce some hybrid model where you have the flexibility to go into an office,
32:12
meet your colleagues, have meet face to face meetings.
32:22
But where you it's part of the new normal to to work from home whenever you do not have constraint to be on site.
32:25
And that's going to be the new normal. So, I mean, it's a good question.
32:34
Relates to one of the other questions asked here is this business of remote
32:38
working during barsoum that actually leads to people travelling a lot less.
32:43
Right. So instead of having a conference on a nice sunny island of which is actually an incredibly pleasant experience,
32:48
people would rather have like a zoom session and just get around and they feel virtuous because because, you know what?
32:56
They've they've not had any carbon emissions as a result of this activity or or whatever.
33:03
I mean, do you see that there's a longer term risk, that people's mindsets will sort of get into this, oh, I shouldn't travel kind of mindset?
33:08
And what does that mean for Amadeus? I mean, do you therefore need to be thinking about developing solutions in other sectors or diversifying somehow?
33:20
Yeah, and it's a very good question.
33:29
And and again, it's it's a there's lots of studies and the corporate strategy decision is obviously trying to predict what the future will be like.
33:31
But nobody really knows.
33:46
I think one a few things that are for sure is that the Business Traveller will will probably never go back to what he was before.
33:49
That's a fact. Another but it will still exist because I still need to go and see customers and and and engage in commercial relations and so on.
33:59
But there is a lot of business travel that can now be done differently and that will probably never, never come back.
34:12
On the other hand, there's also something that is for sure is that like a personal travel, leisure will remain and people still want to go on holiday?
34:21
Yeah, I want to go on holiday. And I'm sure you all want to go on holiday.
34:35
And maybe that will take a different form. And that's what we are also carefully looking at, in particular for airlines.
34:41
Airlines had a lot of help from different governments and most like financial help.
34:49
And for a lot of those airlines that that help came with certain conditions like pulling in France,
34:56
short distance have to be covered now by train and not airlines.
35:06
And so we see a lot more what we call multimodal type of jaune adjoining where you're
35:13
not going to book everything through B.A. or through a B.A. connecting to whatever,
35:19
but you will actually book part of your journey on the train.
35:26
But on on on an aircraft and another part maybe with a shared electric vehicle or something.
35:30
And this is an area where we do pay a lot of attention when we are starting to look at solutions.
35:38
And and part of the diversification I mentioned that we are now working on on looking at how we could create a kind of data space for travel.
35:44
And that's precisely to be able to address this type of diversification and provide solutions that go beyond the airlines.
35:58
So, yeah, yeah. I mean, one of the nicest journeys I ever took was the Eurostar from London to Paris and then getting on crossing
36:07
Paris on the Metro and going to Orly Airport and then getting on a plane and flying to Corsica.
36:15
That was a that was a great trip and a lovely way to to do it.
36:20
As I say, it's actually quite a pleasant meeting of travelling.
36:26
Just another follow up then on ah. On this theme.
36:31
So. Amir asks, In light of the nature of this industry and the fact that you're there behind the scenes and you're
36:34
you're facilitating a lot of things and people don't really know you're responsible for that,
36:46
but if you mess it up, you will become very well known for that.
36:50
Right. So this is how can we then measure the success of the industry in the long term rather than looking at short term travel statistics and stuff?
36:54
How would how would you say, you know, you've been successful over the longer term?
37:08
Yeah, I don't know the questions, I mean, you saw the industry, uh, can you clarify, are you.
37:14
We are asking more about how does Amadeus know have been successful? How would the industry know that's been successful?
37:24
Yeah, so I am more interested in them that I thought that that makes more sense, right?
37:30
Right. Yeah, well, today we we measure our success in in an you obviously a little compliment,
37:36
but we measure our success into how many customers we have and how many actual travel and journeys we sell things to our solutions.
37:44
So in India, in the airline world, our unit is whether it's a passenger on board.
37:54
And that's that's exactly what we use to measure.
38:03
Uh, well, how much are solution users out there?
38:08
And those are the guys that I mentioned earlier are showing there is a decreasing passenger body, then increase again.
38:14
And that's what we we will look at in the future.
38:22
But again, taking into account the fact that we do not only sell airlines, but we also sell of railways.
38:28
We also have a very big part of my day who's looking at hospitality domain.
38:40
And so we also powers that like a reservation and checking system for big hotel groups.
38:46
So we're in that domain. You need to use a bathroom.
38:58
And and that's also part of our diversification strategy and so on.
39:04
Even if travel I mean, during the pandemic, we've seen a drop in travel, especially for a long, long travel.
39:10
But but people have been still when covid rules have been lifted and have been moving around maybe like a car or different mode of transportation.
39:20
But hospitality is a very large a large domain.
39:32
OK. I think it's a couple of recruitment related questions from the students then, so nice to you hire data engineers and data us.
39:39
Do you have programmes for first year to take part in, like spring or summer internships?
39:51
And so on the first we do hire data engineers, we have groups of of data engineers.
39:59
I can tell you right now, because it's always evolving.
40:10
Where? Well, we we have positions and how many and so on.
40:15
But that's what you can find on the on the link we provided on the on the last slide and and we do of internships uh as well.
40:19
Uh, we don't have a rule that says we don't take Fusi or we only take that.
40:32
Yeah. I think we are looking at building a relation with we students or we publish our internship opportunities on our website.
40:40
And I will also work with William and Tom to, uh, to advertise that.
40:50
Uh, but yeah, we do have internship opportunities.
40:55
We usually look at, uh, internship opportunities for, uh, by default is either six months or 12 months.
41:00
But we have done shorter internships in the past as well. So.
41:10
That's something we can discuss if you show interest in.
41:15
Great, I'll put the links there to the Omidyar's job site.
41:19
If anybody is interested in the chat, any other last minute questions, I think we have time for one or two more questions if anyone's got one.
41:23
And if not, now you have an e-mail address, so please don't hesitate to reach out and we'll be happy to get back to you for sure.
41:42
Yeah, and if anybody needs contact with with medius or indeed other companies, just approach, either Tom or myself would be happy to put you in touch.
41:50
Right. OK, what if nobody has any questions?
42:02
Well, we'll close it there, but thank you very much, Patrick and Janine.
42:08
That was really fascinating. Really enjoyed that. Always, always good to keep in touch with you guys.
42:13
If you want more questions, just come in. As I was talking from Joshua, how far does Omidyar's pitch into the cargo industry?
42:21
Right. This is very interesting that you've got all these planes flying around the top third of it, all full of the passengers.
42:29
And the bottom two thirds are full of very valuable cargo. Right.
42:35
And how is how is the cargo industry in in in covid times and how much involved in that are you?
42:41
Great question. Thank you. Yeah, it's a very good question and maybe not a very good answer.
42:49
But we we we have we have been working on we have been maintaining and operating a cargo solution for several years.
42:58
And actually on behalf of of you and I've personally worked on this application actually many, many moons ago.
43:11
And and, uh,
43:20
but but it's not something it's not an activity we are doing at the moment and that we are contemplating and that we have been looking at.
43:22
But it's very specialised and and and quite niche.
43:33
We are dealing with cargo activity for airlines that carry cargo as part of the day to day operations.
43:38
So it'll be, uh, takes operate some cargo operations in their regular aircraft.
43:49
Thank you, uh, for the for the display. And, um, but but pure cargo application is not something that we we do right now.
44:01
I don't know if you want to implement it.
44:17
No, that's that's true, as we have mentioned, and this was the picture for four passenger plane with cargo in it,
44:21
and for this we have software, too, that takes this into account to balance the aircraft, but it's not dedicated to to cargo.
44:30
And yet the one thing interesting is cargo is actually doing better now than in twenty nine to.
44:41
Yeah, that's interesting. If ever you wonder, by the way,
44:53
why those cargo boxes look like they do the little unit load devices here that you see underneath the seats now, you know.
44:56
You know. Yeah, that it's fascinating, isn't it, and particularly what you were talking about when you're talking about balancing the aircraft right.
45:04
Into respecting the order in which, for example,
45:18
the fuel burns off in the fuel tanks and the order in which the cargo has to be loaded and unloaded and so on, it is a fascinating problem.
45:21
Absolutely. That's that's a very, very interesting. And, yeah, it takes it's very complex algorithms that take into account the like.
45:30
Well, there's actually hooked into into the hold to load the cargo, how to load it and so on.
45:41
So it's really fascinating. Brilliant.
45:48
All right, well, let's let's close it by then. Thank you very much, Patrick. Thank you so much.
45:52
And that was that was fascinating. Thank you.
45:57
Thank you. Bye bye.
