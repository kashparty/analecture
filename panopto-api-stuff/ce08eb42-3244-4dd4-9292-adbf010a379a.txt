Title: DM Oct 12 Lecture Recording
Category: Discrete Mathematics
Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 12/10/2021
Good morning, everybody. We're here for the second lecture of the disagreements,
0:05
and you can see on the screen that we start with doing an exercise and giving you about 10 minutes to try to do this.
0:13
Please, please bear in mind that when I say prove I am,
0:22
I mean that you have to use the 15 or so rules that we have on the steps that we have discussed on Friday.
0:28
So you're not allowed to do anything else and using those tips.
0:39
OK, I'll tell you. And again, about bottom. OK, I hope you were tremendously successful doing these two exercises.
0:44
We will discuss a few more during this hour, but let me give you a way to try to do this.
9:47
So, first of all, you need to understand the thing that you need to prove now, though,
9:56
before you can construct the proof, you have to understand whether this movie was a bit like writing computer code.
10:02
You need to know which you implemented before you start writing the code now.
10:09
So in this particular case, the first case, I start with an end statement and I get an end statement at the end.
10:13
So the intuitively it's very,
10:21
very clear that this application has to hold because we know that the the the truth of the statement B and Q it's true is both being true.
10:24
And then, of course, you and B is true then as well now is that there should be perfectly OK, but that's not the truth.
10:38
So the the a lot of mathematicians who approved it give the intuition why the book is supposed to.
10:46
And then everybody says, yeah, yeah, I understand what you say, then you don't need to write on proof.
10:56
Yeah. But of course did not put a prophase but in detail.
11:01
Check the holes using the 15 steps, 15 proof construction steps that I've specified.
11:06
OK, so this particular case, I am going towards an end state that so and so it implies.
11:18
So I start by writing this stuff that I can safely assume now being Kooistra.
11:27
OK, now I need to go to this statement and then and how can I show an end to this?
11:39
I have to show you and I have to show people separately and combine them together.
11:47
So can I show you, for example, from the statement?
11:52
And the fact is, yes, that's true. Now, by using and.
11:57
We know that, you know, then why not so?
12:08
From Cuba to witness.
12:22
Yeah, so we have to Teweles. Similarly.
12:30
Fields'.
12:39
Now, I can write the same sentence again, but as I write similarly, it means that the statement that I made before is true also for the very next day.
12:42
So they've both been cohorts. Yeah. And then.
12:54
By showing in. You might be.
13:00
Oh, it's so time. You implies.
13:13
We have that the and Hugh.
13:27
Implies no, so the.
13:36
You could you could economise on brackets, etc., but that's not the issue at the moment.
13:44
So I've used three rules here I'm using and I'm using.
13:49
And then again, I do the show and Angoulême showing a place now.
13:54
So the structure of the pool is completely clear. I've made all the steps.
14:01
I've written down the steps to convince the reader that I'm actually using the method that is that is proscribed.
14:06
So this property includes. And certainly if you are requesting a.
14:13
So for two, it's a bit more tricky, little bit with them.
14:24
So now I need to again. So I start saying. Assume you're OK now I need to show a of or statement there now.
14:29
So how do I show your statement? Well, I showed it. I told all of that is true.
14:46
Not because then reducing or I can show you your statement, but I don't know,
14:51
I so if I show cute and and if I should be down there as well, but I can't do either because I don't know which one is true.
14:58
Yeah. So the information that I'm given is an overstatement therefore.
15:05
We are going to strip this information apart, yeah.
15:13
So we're looking at the two cases now,
15:22
so the information is in law and we need now to construct a proof that comes to the same conclusion in both branches.
15:25
So we need to go to the proof that this shows a statement on twice.
15:33
OK, so what is the structure of the my cases where you think each individual statement is an assumption and the reason for that?
15:40
Yeah. So first of all, the issue would then be false.
15:50
So by no means no pitons, OK?
15:59
And if we assume you. No.
16:07
Then Kumuls, so this is this is going in the right direction, because now I can do the oil, but I cannot say now, therefore, by.
16:15
Showing poor people who Moltz know, so I cannot write this,
16:35
so this I'm writing this explicitly because this is an exam question of last year and students did it like this.
16:44
This is incorrect because what I have here is that my Grimes's and we all do not go to the same results now.
16:52
So I need to roll this back. I mean, the line of thought is correct, but the structure is incorrect.
17:00
Now, there's not a Panopto, so I'm holding this back.
17:05
And so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to do this or step here.
17:12
No, I did the same thing then just in a different order,
17:29
because my all step allows me to put the extra information on either side of the statement that I have no feeling wants.
17:35
So now I have a two branches in the cases that have the same conclusion,
17:46
and therefore I can say so people you know, it's not so monitored by the layout of the proof as well.
17:51
And outside, assuming, you know, is independent of the choice, this against status, independent of the choice,
18:04
because in both cases of the choices, I've got a simple question, which is this and then not saying.
18:13
Showing implies we have that the more you.
18:26
I'm going to and I am going in the world, and nobody nobody stopped me.
18:36
Why do you have to say then by sharing implies P or Q and it's true or something like that.
18:46
I come to your question immediately after I erase this incredibly stupid mistake and make no mistake.
18:57
OK, so let me first correct this and then be a competitor. So that should be you will.
19:09
And this. So your question was so like when you say, for example, so by showing or cue up,
19:16
he holds, what does it mean by sharing or why can't you just say therefore he holds?
19:49
Because I'm stating the step, the U.S. So this is the name of the step.
19:56
Sharing or OK, you go to the notes on the side, you will see that they were put on the list.
20:05
OK, thank you. I mean, it would be better perhaps if I use different colours for the different things that have even slowed down tremendously.
20:16
Yeah, so the beauty of these things is that now, once we have proven this, this holds forever.
20:31
So if you are now asked to prove a particular statement, which it is convenient that you can,
20:39
you know, swap the arguments in the law, then you can refer back to this proof that it was good.
20:48
Now, you don't need to show it again. So that's that's a good thing.
20:54
Of course, if I asked you to prove the statement, then you can't say, well,
21:00
you did it in the elections and therefore I don't need to do that because that's, of course, not what you answered.
21:04
So I have the using all step stepdown. I have the showing that I have to shows that you and I have.
21:11
Yeah. Pardon me?
21:26
You just said that there are some that since we've proven in class the Pentagon situation, we don't need to prevent the exam.
21:31
How do we know which ones are which? Which ones? We need to know the formulation of the question.
21:37
If I ask you to prove that statement, then you can't say you've done it in class.
21:44
Or if I asked you to prove the statement in the proof of that statement, you need to properly ensure in.
21:49
Then you can say this property is shown in class and therefore I don't need to prove it belongs.
21:55
OK, thank you. They so did the the kind of properties that you can do in this bit,
22:01
these steps are a massive I will not go into too much detail because this is actually more part of the logic component that's going to follow.
22:14
So I don't want to talk too much on the on the election's toes and still the thunder.
22:26
Yeah, but I want to add one particular example.
22:35
Yeah. So I have a question about like by showing and by using like it's I mean by using something,
22:40
you already have a property and you don't want to use that to like to get something.
22:49
But by showing it you need to prove something.
22:55
Right. OK. Can I ask you, do you have to know that hand.
22:58
You have to know the notes there with you. It's a yes or no question.
23:07
I think it's a no go and it's the best thing to do when you attend these lectures have to know it's ready because I might refer as I do now,
23:19
I might refer to the notes and then you have to look at them and read Bitney.
23:30
OK, so it's very important that you have to know if you go through the notes, you will see that definition of wrong to the rules are mentions.
23:35
Now, all the steps and they have names, what's called the assumption.
23:44
The other one is called showing end the losing end, showing more using law.
23:49
Yeah. And the notes describe what happens in the step, how you apply the step.
23:54
What is the conclusion that you can take? What are the words that you need to know?
24:00
So I'm going to read the notes in the construction of this book,
24:05
which means of these are the notes that are on on on as I mentioned in the first lecture, the notes from materials.
24:11
And I think in the chart, people actually gave out the link. Did you not get.
24:23
Yako, any of these problems we're not using using the using step by using every showing and not using in any of these.
24:33
No, no. So, so, so. So the difference is the following. If you want to construct a statement that has the word or in the middle,
24:45
then you do that by showing or you are showing your proving the statement at the top.
24:54
If you are building a coup, using an information that has a law in there regard decomposing, then you're using that for.
25:02
Yeah, so in this particular case, it was back here, I start with an assumption of P and Q holds,
25:14
so I'm decomposing this information next, striking it being pulled separately and the step, the dust that is used against.
25:23
Thank you. Now, sorry, another quick question during the state, are the safe assumption here explicitly?
25:33
The aides I've talked explicitly here have said issue is that what you mean?
25:45
Yeah. So do we need to say that by so by step assumption we have B and Q is true as we did last year.
25:51
OK, OK. So so this of course the issue is how literally are you following the wording that I have in the notes?
25:59
And I admit there is a little bit of leeway there for how you formulate this particular thing.
26:06
What are the words that you use? Like, for example, do you say we have those are things that you can choose.
26:13
But what is important is the sequence of the steps.
26:20
Yeah, and that therefore it is handy if you're right on the steps. I can see whether the steps that you're using.
26:26
So when I write on assume this holds, then that is by assumption.
26:33
So it is the same as saying by the assumption of yours.
26:39
Know, so I could have added here, I could have added here.
26:45
Then by assumption. P Q holds little space right now, so I could have added that, but so this is for example,
26:54
this is these little things you can omit because it's it's actually it's it's repeating the information that was there before.
27:13
Already I've assumed that an old Soviet by assumption. So that's that's the same thing.
27:21
OK, yeah. The thing is that the I need to flag it explicitly as an assumption because in the
27:28
final statement it becomes part of the implied and it no longer is an assumption.
27:37
You flag the things as the assumptions are the things that you assume to be true before you start.
27:43
OK, so for example, so things that are trickier on things like.
27:51
No statement like that. That is far, far more tricky.
28:04
Let me put some brackets on there so there's no details.
28:09
So how would you do this? I wouldn't give this as an exercise in the first week, but I'll show you how to do this one.
28:13
So what I do know is we want to assume. Did not not beholds.
28:21
Uh. I want to go to Ft.
28:35
How can I go to peace from here? I can't there's nothing there that allows me to go to.
28:42
So how can I go to a conclusiveness that I don't have a rule that allows me to remove not from a statement, for example?
28:49
Yeah. So the only thing that I can do is the I can try to show that I can if I should not be, then I got I go to a contradiction.
28:56
Yeah. We also.
29:13
Must be so hooked up with them right down here, this is not part of the proof,
29:25
but you can insert it in the proof as a clarification of what you're doing.
29:32
Now, the reason towards a constitutional.
29:36
OK, now. The trick here is,
29:47
and this is cool and creative step that you don't ultimately get by just looking at the problem is that we are going to use the North Slope.
29:51
We're going to use the most exclusive middle. So.
30:01
So there's not that assumption noted. So we know that the will be.
30:16
It's true. OK, so you can always direct it in whatever you want and you can take anything you like for that particular statement.
30:25
In this particular case, I explicitly used to say, you know, so by cases, we did have another statement here that he holds.
30:32
No, if he holds no sign, there's an assumption.
30:45
Assume that the whole and what I needed to show is that beholds and so I did.
30:55
That's true.
31:02
OK, so in this particular case, you do repeat it because you have the the the conclusion of this that the conclusion of the steps feels OK.
31:03
And the second step is that not the courts.
31:15
OK. Now, I'm looking at the fact that I also have that moment, so I have two assumptions here.
31:24
I have the local people and if they're not people, so we have contradiction.
31:39
With the first assumption that this again, these extra words with the first assumption is not necessary, but it clarifies that.
31:53
So we reject. The assumption now.
32:06
The lost the assumption now. So why prove a contradiction?
32:22
The scenario is that by contradiction.
32:30
We have to be. Always rejecting the not the assumption that we made.
32:38
So can you explain this problem again? What is it you want to explain?
32:55
So we was it a second assumption? Not be.
33:01
We also assume, Marty. But then one of the cases you'll be also is that a of.
33:05
I know. So so the statement that I have and then I can take a no holds is that every statement is true or not true.
33:15
So the statement between P and M.P., that's a true statement, although I don't need consumate.
33:32
It's it's it's a fact now, but I don't know which one.
33:38
So I, I go with assuming that beholds then a safe, peaceful Dumpty's job.
33:44
That's OK. And if not peaceful, don't we have a contradiction. So there cannot be.
33:50
So we have to be truthful. What was the law of excluded middle class?
33:55
It says that be or not, people for every. Oh, so is that is that is that truth, what you call the law of excluded middle?
34:05
Yes, it's called the Nexium. It's the fund.
34:16
It follows the foundational things in classical mathematics. It is.
34:19
Yeah. OK, so not be more in philosophy of mathematics now.
34:25
I mean there are certain types of of mathematics and logic and which that this was rejected now where they say,
34:30
well if you want to say that an overstatement is true, you have to have a proof of all of the components.
34:39
You can't just say this. And there are examples of statements that that are true, but we don't know that are true or false,
34:45
but we don't know which like, for example, I think is called the called my copart conjecture.
34:56
Every even number can be written off as some of the primes.
35:05
They checked it for an enormously large number.
35:10
And it's true, but they haven't checked it all.
35:14
So we don't we don't have conclusive proof that he holds the probability, either true or false, that we don't know which.
35:17
Yeah. So in that context, stating that probability is true or false is a bit old now.
35:25
But if you do not have this rule in your arguments, in your in your reasoning,
35:32
then a lot of the mathematical world collapses and mathematicians don't like that.
35:38
So they say most of the middle that does work with them, even if one thinks that escapers.
35:45
So what was the reason for assuming not being in the second line?
35:51
Because in my opinion or I don't know which one holds, I need to show that in both cases of the or I come to the same conclusion.
35:57
No, I mean, at the start of the book, we also assume not the end result towards a contradiction.
36:05
What is the result of that? Oh, yeah, OK, fair enough.
36:11
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. So we should be it is it.
36:24
I think I made a hash of this, I made it.
36:38
So could we have a shower? Not not pee and using not then he holds.
36:42
It implies pee. So just just a confirmation we're supposed to remove that line and just use of law, exclude administrator.
36:48
Of course, you just don't to I honestly, I'm always I mean, you're not the first one to ask me that kind of question every bit.
37:06
As soon as you ask me that kind of question, I'm always baffled.
37:14
Do you think there is stuff that I do in this lecture that you don't need to know? Do you think I'm trying to keep you off the street or something?
37:19
Of course, everything we do in this lecture is something you need to know every single thing.
37:28
So to go back to the to the show, there are some exercises on Kate, the stuff that you have to hand in this Friday.
37:43
So it is Thursday. I've put the deadline, I think, just before the lecture starts at four o'clock to make sure that not everybody,
37:51
of course, my my fellow lectures have put their deadlines at 7:00.
37:59
And I think that it conflicts with going to the lecture itself.
38:04
And that's not a good thing. So I've set my deadline of 4:00 AM.
38:07
There are five proves to do that. The first three should be straightforward and the last two are a little bit more tricky,
38:12
especially the first one is a little bit more in order to get those things to fly.
38:18
So I repeat, the level in which we do these exercises here is not the the thing that we do in the
38:24
course now in India that I will do proofs and I will do proofs using these steps.
38:34
But we will not work with statements like being here anymore because that's how
38:41
we will deal with actual mathematical statements about the properties of assets,
38:45
for example, in an uprooted property of using the technique.
38:50
But what I want you to understand is in building these pools, these are the 15 steps he said.
38:55
This is the machinery that you cannot that you can use. Yes.
39:03
This I'm sorry I opened the last time I open the microphone by mistake.
39:07
I just wanted to ask, where are we supposed to submit the assignment?
39:12
It's electronic and I've never done it myself. So it's you have to follow the instructions everywhere.
39:18
I think you need to it's an electronic submission so you can you can handwrite it, you can type it.
39:27
You can do what you like. You can detect it if you know how to do that.
39:35
And then do, of course, submission. I think we can't do that in the case.
39:40
We cannot submit that for other causes.
39:48
We have a pattern in place like homework, but we don't have a pattern we can take.
39:52
We have to repeat the story so far.
40:04
Of course, you have your your your coursework that you have to hand in and so you have to hand it in physically for us.
40:06
Of course, we have electronic submission button so that we click.
40:15
OK, ok, ok. OK, I'll, I'll, I'll.
40:20
I thought I clicked it. I'll go back and get immediately after the lecture and fixed it.
40:25
That, that's going to be fun. Yeah. So, so what.
40:31
I wanted to. Yeah.
40:36
So I mean it's clear from how badly this means that doing improve is not straightforward, you know,
40:40
I mean there are particular cases where it is straightforward and this is where the the
40:47
structure of the the statement that you need to show guys the structure of the book.
40:53
Now, in this particular case, I know that they have to use the low screw middle.
40:58
But who do I go wrong? Because here I'm as you pointed out, I'm not using this assumption at all.
41:03
And I should be originally told this. This is this is badly constructed.
41:10
So I need to I'm sorry, I won't go to the proof again, but I'll I'll write it out.
41:16
And so the next election, I'll show it before the next starts so you can have a look at the proof.
41:21
Should be OK.
41:26
So the final thing I would like to say is that the in in mathematics, what is used is the there is a mapping from from words to formulas.
41:29
And so we have to the end statement, for example, P and Q,
41:45
which are written the words that is written as the and Q So we will see that in the logic was that this transformation takes place.
41:53
I will use this in the course as well. I will, I will use the appropriate mathematical notation, but I want you to be very careful now.
42:02
So you have to and we have to or we have to implies you have to exist.
42:10
We have to rule I the estimates and I think this is all.
42:16
Yeah. And but you can only use this in a formula.
42:20
So I don't right, there exist a man.
42:26
Yeah, something like that. So what is the last thing the No.7 looking for?
42:34
So if you if you so. If you want to ride, there exists, said the so we'll talk about shortening, shortening sidestep.
42:47
So if you want to say this, you can't say there exist. As I said, this is nonsense now.
43:05
So this is not permitted. And this symbol here.
43:13
Yeah. You can't have say I came home and then ate the sandwich.
43:17
Now, so is this worth this symbol that is to be part of a formula that should be linking something that is true or false?
43:31
And so that is true or false. You can't build something and hoping that, you know, this is nonsense, it should be worth then.
43:39
So never, ever, ever, ever, ever. Right. This symbol, when you should be writing a word.
43:47
OK, you lose points. I very rigorously mark you down if you use logical symbols in a sentence.
43:54
OK, you can only use the logical symbol in a formula.
44:03
But excuse me, sir. Now, go ahead, I'm sorry to take you back just a little bit, but going back to the implies showing and using rules you gave us.
44:09
Yeah. Do we need to memorise all of them? Of course.
44:18
OK, thank you so much. That's 15 things that you need to memorise to is so much more common in discourse that you need to memorise.
44:23
Your brain is going to flow over. Welcome to Imperial College, guys.
44:31
You have to answer it, so the trick is, if you understand it, you don't need to memorise it because,
44:42
you know, you think I can make you up at night and you just spit the rules out is not a problem with them.
44:48
It's like I mean, I repeat, nobody complains about learning the Haskell.
44:56
Nobody of you says, do I need to know the whole syntax? Nobody complains about.
45:03
This is similar.
45:09
This is a topic it has a political system inside, you have to learn the system if you want to get a good grade for the poor, for the for the effort.
45:10
Of course, you have to know this. Yeah, phobics, so this thing that I think is worth a lot,
45:18
because you've come from a culture in school where your are very likely used logical symbols,
45:32
incentives as well, and it's a certain degree of freedom that you came in with.
45:41
I want you to strictly separate the language in which region about formulas and formulas.
45:46
Now, it's like writing a text about, I don't know, in English about Sanskrit.
45:52
You can't use the Sanskrit words as a substitute for the English words and hoping that it makes sense.
46:00
You can't do that. So the implies is only allowed.
46:09
So we can safely. Implies Kyun now, so I can appreciate this as an abbreviation of being class.
46:14
Q But now on the left and right that is implied, it's unfortunate or false.
46:25
So this is a correct use. This is an incorrect use. Excuse me, sir.
46:30
Would you please explain the meaning of limitations that we can only use in formulas, the six things you've written?
46:44
You want me to explain them? Yeah, that's OK, that's OK.
46:54
So these are the in the notes.
46:58
Let me quickly go a bit further ahead.
47:02
So on in the notes, it is on page 19 body.
47:09
The mapping is giving. No, I can repeat it here, but it's better because a lot of writing is involved in that.
47:13
We don't we only have two minutes left for this section, so to speak.
47:21
So it's important to note that for me, the official formulas are abbreviations of the statements that I have with the words.
47:28
So I use this symbol only. So they said before, and I use it as an abbreviation of the word and.
47:39
Now, that is a very important thing.
47:47
So this notation is for the plantation of mathematics, introduced for brevity, not to substitute something not not not to push something out.
47:50
OK, so so the the notes are roughly 50 pages.
48:02
My part, I don't know what my colleagues are doing. I've told you when we started that I'm not sure we can cover everything.
48:13
We'll see how far we can go.
48:20
And the thing is, the if we have a normal exam, then the you will have nothing against really other than your your pen.
48:24
And that's the only thing you're allowed to bring in. So all the knowledge that I'm transferring you through the notes include the latest.
48:35
I assume you have absorbed this one that I don't.
48:43
That includes everything that's in there in the not in the notes,
48:48
with the exception of the the sections and the examples that have a little asterisks before
48:52
I consider those to be supplementary in the sense that they are for further reading.
48:59
If you're interested in the topic of the day, I'm not really part of what I what everything else is examinable.
49:05
OK, I'm going to finish any last questions, and so, yeah, yeah, right, yes.
49:22
Can I see your ureters solution for the previous exercises?
49:32
Thank you. Thank you.
49:40
OK, so what I will do after the stop,
49:51
I will cancel this out and put the real truth in there and then I'll I'll put this file also on all materials so you can have it.
49:53
So all the material, all the stuff that we're going to like is going to be quite a lot over the next couple of weeks,
50:04
I will say separately in separate files. But of course, you're going to lose contact with the reporting.
50:10
OK, that's it. Yeah, quickly.
50:18
Somebody wanted to ask the question, I'm sorry, can I ask a question about one of the exercises?
50:28
Why other exercises? I don't know. Can I ask a question about one of the exercises or one of the exercises, I should say?
50:37
Is there something in the force longer required to prove that if we have for every X, we have to be from X?
50:47
Yes. No, no, no. Sorry. That's that's too much. OK, but we go back about that.
50:57
No, not in the lecture. I'm happy to go back to exercises after you've had them.
51:06
And I'm more than happy to do that because I suggest you discuss with your fellow students and and find solutions to that.
51:12
I have no problem with that at all. But I don't want to talk about finding a solution for the thing was that they had to submit.
51:21
OK, so you're very homophobic, aren't you?
51:32
OK, I'm going to stop the recording now. We're just going to ask, when you say holds, does it mean to.
51:43
Yes, it is. A statement holds that is to be specified in the police maintenance.
51:51
Goodey.
