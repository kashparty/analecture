Hi there and welcome back. So earlier on, we set up this superheros problem in light session.
0:02
I want to run through a couple of ways of proving this and then talk about some of the pros and cons of the approaches.
0:10
So let's first of all, start with something quite familiar to you. Last just natural deduction.
0:16
So here you can see I've laid things out on screen for us. Let's think about how we approach solving or proving this property.
0:20
Given the givens, one, two, three, four. And they're trying to get to this new state.
0:27
We won't say that. Well, for every supervillain that happens. So first, it starts with the goal of game four.
0:32
And we can solve it. We have to deal with a Farole, which means we need to use a fraud constuction rule to get to this point.
0:38
So that means that we need to take an arbitrary.
0:45
Entity, Marzotto Group, given that was the entity one sample, and then we need to get to a state where we can search for that entity.
0:50
They need to get to a state where we can show the entity that suits it and grew it a happy group.
0:54
I'm going abbreviate these terms just to save the writing time.
1:00
So if the guru implies happy, can be H.
1:05
Now, again, you can look at the structure of this and see it's an implication.
1:13
So another implication, introduction, it's probably to get us to the state.
1:17
So from on line six, it's now going to draw new books because making that assumption.
1:21
First one, we can pass through introduction constant. So now I'm making assumptions.
1:32
We're going to assume like six. That group is a separate and.
1:37
So our assumption. And we need to start again at the bottom down here.
1:45
We have got to some. Happy to.
1:52
So then at this point, no longer perhaps midlist, sure about how to this thing a little bit about what we've got and posable.
1:59
So the only way we're gonna get to kind of happiness is to be able to use this first property here, because I think has happy on the right hand side.
2:09
So we know that Grew is a super villain and we know this property only applies to people, which means we need to get competitive.
2:19
And thankfully, we have our refactored. Given what I'd given number four lousier to convert a seat for them to a person.
2:27
So on line seven, I can say that that person.
2:35
One group that was born using for all.
2:41
Outright elimination. On nine six system using line four as well.
2:46
So you'd like for today to convert grew into a person.
2:55
So again, now that we know what we're going for, we can easily line one. Let's work ourselves back a little bit from the go.
3:01
We know we need to get to the right hand side of happy for a loved one.
3:08
The only way we can do that is if the line before we have shown that we have grew as a person.
3:13
And for all of grooms, children.
3:20
We can show that they are rich. Not a basis for unpacking this back one step.
3:29
Then that would be asked using the for all I wrote, elimination rule on line one.
3:37
And then some line does tend to follow.
3:45
In much similar way, we can look at this new goal line and we can see that the only way we're going to get into this situation is in an introduction.
3:48
We've already got on line seven.
3:58
The fact that grew as a person says, well, we would care about then is producing the other side, the right hand side of things.
4:00
So we need to go to show that for all the children grew.
4:08
Done by Ulrich. And now we find ourselves suddenly back in a case like where the original go.
4:18
We have for all. So now we need to use a through introduction here.
4:29
So this is going to be some line by line.
4:35
So just like we took a random. Well, arbitrary SSA entity before no do the same thing.
4:40
So I'm going to pick arbitrarily. Agnes will not pick any one of group children to want to use real one.
4:48
So that's the kind of rule introduction constant here.
4:58
And then we need to get to them the right hand side of.
5:03
They need to establish a line where we have our property for the particular child.
5:13
The documents which are. So out of.
5:19
I can use. Implied.
5:24
Rich. Goodness. And then this one similar approach.
5:31
We have a implies introduction. Which can be on some line, mom going to run second.
5:37
So get another box. Quite a few boxes and boxes here and Fred. So were the times of maps dutchie person to try and keep him at least very doing it.
5:46
So now we need to say, well, we're assuming the left hand side saw it on line nine is going to be.
5:56
Chantal. Africanness. I'm going to get to the fact that she is rich, which means that's what I'll get to.
6:04
So this problem here is the assumption. What we can do at this point is it gets a bit messy.
6:16
I mean, it did unpack this slightly to the right, try and make things fit.
6:23
So we know that we are looking for a rich. The only way we get to Rich is by rule number 30.
6:27
So that tells us that we're going to be doing all our elimination using one three.
6:35
Get the fact that we have a super villain. Hackman's.
6:45
And where did the silver bullet come from? Well, we can look back and say, well, they don't get it,
6:52
Symphonia if we can prove that the parent tobacconists is superior because then I'm going to be Superman or conversely,
6:56
think about it, that Agnes is the child of Superman.
7:04
So, again, it's going to be another use of of Rubell implies indignation this time using the second rule to us.
7:08
And that's going to give us the fact that we need to know. Exists some.
7:18
Why such? That show of.
7:24
I can guess why. And supervillain, why do we have the left hand side, then we can go to the right hand side.
7:31
That's going to be one of mine. And then then they do that connect up the fact that we basically do already have.
7:48
Was mentioned because it got from like nine. The child of.
7:55
I can use. True, that's true.
8:02
And supervening group, that's true as well. So this is a reduction.
8:08
On lines nine and six.
8:15
And that then allows us to do our. Existence production from line 10.
8:21
To hear say, look, we had a particular case. Agnes is a child of grew and grew supervision.
8:35
That means that there is some entity that is the child, I guess, the child of that Superman.
8:40
And then basically we can complete the work,
8:47
filling in all of the boxes down the right hand side and everything will work out much march the end of the split second time,
8:50
going to skip forward to my pretty printed version from before. If I told you how I approach producing something of that fall first.
8:55
So it's a little bit cumbersome to fits in boxes. As always, probably not seduction.
9:05
And you can see the what we've really done here is we've reduced all of our knowledge from the given's one to four,
9:09
basically down to the barest minimal atomic properties that we know, and then recombine them back up again to give you a stiff go.
9:16
And that's basically what that touch would do every time. So that works and it's quite mechanical and how you approach it.
9:24
But it's not always the most intuitive. I'm not really convinced you gain much insight into how this works going via this mechanism.
9:32
So let's look at it from a slightly different point of view then. So I'm willing do just now what we call in this course a stylised proof.
9:39
So we still going to be bound by the rules of first logic and very much everything you've done is gonna be applicable.
9:46
It's just that we're now bringing in the village to work at a higher level of thinking and using
9:53
clearances members to be able to make us progress a bit more speedily and more readily in bigger steps.
9:58
And that's not allowed to go away. So let me say by example and again, let's talk about how we do these proofs in practise.
10:04
So we are trying to show some thing of rural property right up through accident X and Y subjects.
10:13
So the way we always go about this, if we take an arbitrary. Entity for this.
10:21
Property. So take arbitrary. Grew.
10:27
Why not just stick with the style we're using for. And then because we're dealing them with implication.
10:32
We can say, let's assume. First assumption that we have a super villain.
10:40
Group. And that's going to do so far.
10:48
It just is kind of setting up the proof and nobody to get to the point that we have a happy group as well.
10:52
Again, very similar approach would we did for just working top down now as well.
10:58
So we can now look at information. We know we have a citizen, we know we're trying to get to happy.
11:03
So we kind of can tell at this point that the only way as before we're going to make any progress here
11:08
is to be able to use our first give them what they ought to do now is going to substitute in group.
11:13
Throughout this particular given to get you.
11:19
So because this property is Rolex, I can choose to be given a property, which means I end up with a person grue for all.
11:22
Why? Child of war.
11:31
Guru, wise, rich, white.
11:37
I mean, all of that means I have a happy group.
11:42
And that's just from. Given one can I know that I have a group that I can talk to into this, that we can also look at this and say, well, OK.
11:49
Similar to for. What else do I know? Well, I know that I've assumed the super villain and therefore I can deduce grew as a person.
11:59
But this follows from our assumption. Simpson one.
12:09
And also from our rule number four voters.
12:17
So now we're in a situation where I've got a person I was before I look at this and say what I've dispatched off this side of things, that's all good.
12:23
So what I need to do now is think about how to approach this thing and how to deal with the fact of proving that all of Cruz children are rich.
12:33
So that's a fraud, obviously. So same approaches before I take an arbitrary.
12:41
Fine. Edith, this time will not decide differently.
12:49
So pick an arbitrary child of Cruz and then we can do the similar approach but left legal implication.
12:52
So we assume left hand side. So it seems that to which to be the child of.
13:00
Edith. Grew, which means that it is the type of group that that's not something I care.
13:08
And now you've got to walk towards working out that it is going to be rich.
13:14
So what we can do here is think about it and say, okay, we know that it is the child, the group.
13:18
You know, the group is a certain villain. So therefore, we can now make logical step of reducing the Edith insipient super villain.
13:26
If not from using our two assumptions, so we know that it is in child childhood.
13:35
We know that group is a super villain and we have our roof supervillains being inherited, which is rule two.
13:45
So that gives us the Ederson super villain. But then our next step can be to say, well, then Edith must be rich.
13:56
And that just follows from. Line seven says that it's the villain.
14:05
And then I'll rule three that said that every supervillain is rich.
14:12
So much each step that now we need to kind of realise what we've done here is we've shown this was an arbitrary choice of child,
14:16
of gurus, and therefore we can get kind of upper level. Come back to the biggest thing you want in particular.
14:27
This tells us that for all. Why? Child of why?
14:34
Guerrieri implies. Richwine.
14:41
So this follows from. Al.
14:46
Sumption in two. Gone from an assumption footprint, efforts to the back side.
14:53
That's our assumption. Two, it's also from the property on a lot of bugs as line eight, improvement and importantly.
14:59
That it was an arbitrary choice of entity that.
15:10
And that does suggest that indeed, we do now know that any child or will end up being rich.
15:16
Then we can at that point say that we have. Happy group.
15:22
Which follows from the fact that we've using our rules, that we've already kind of stopped this, we're get groups of rule five as a new target.
15:30
That could be revoked. Rule one in terms of new rule five is specific to group.
15:38
So we've used that rules of rule five. We've already established.
15:43
And then it's the fact that Gry, as I said, one six is a person.
15:48
And then from the fact on line nine, which is deduced that all of group children are going to be rich and that families would be happy.
15:52
And that when we just to continue statement says thus. Alpha doesn't think it holds.
16:01
And that's because we've taken our assumption. One.
16:09
From our assumption of having a supervillain got to that sense of being happy.
16:15
And similarly to a couple and above both things, Grey was an arbitrary choice when states go and hit.
16:20
So again, that proof kind of gets that. And I think it's a bit more direct in how we've gone about it.
16:27
Obviously, we need to think about our tactical, how we're going to get that. But I feel this is a more direct proof.
16:32
Takes a bit less time is about 10 steps. I'm turning me here.
16:37
Is the previous proof about 15 steps internally? And we didn't have to reduce everything to it's kind of smaller, small atoms.
16:41
And then we build them and we them piece by piece.
16:47
We're able to kind of mix slightly bigger steps because we're more confident in where we're planting things.
16:50
However, it is important to justify those steps.
16:55
And that's why here on the right hand side, I write down whenever I kind make a step, a justification for what's going on in done.
16:57
And this is going to be the kind of proof that we're going to be in currently to move towards as we go throughout this module, this term.
17:05
So stop there. We talked a couple times, have gotten prick's if you want to.
17:12
And then the next video I'm going to look up kind of contrasting different types of proof is spoken about today.
17:16
Thanks.
