Title: DM Oct 8 2021 Lecture Recording
Category: Discrete Mathematics
Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 11/10/2021
It's a lecture of the the new conglomerate, if you like, of the different topics, which is a discrete maths, logic and reasoning.
0:02
The first four and a half, almost five pages will be occupied by me.
0:15
And so I'm going to give you the maths material of this course and the let me show you the.
0:20
Slide's. You'll see the slides.
0:33
Yes, yes, good. So this is the I like I said this the district mathematics park I've been call for a few years.
0:55
I had to condense them into a little bit to make it fit into the debate about now.
1:07
But I hope it's still a very, very interesting for and the selected time so that I've decided to do all my lectures online.
1:13
Not really competent yet. I've been in the department and have seen it.
1:23
Not everybody scaffolds, so don't really too good with that.
1:26
And also because the you're so many, you're going to be if I would be teaching in person, you would be in separate rooms anyway.
1:30
So at the last part you would anyway before the you do now.
1:38
So I don't really see a real benefit.
1:43
We can organise in-person meetings that you appreciate to go through problems, but it has to be in smaller groups.
1:46
OK, so this is a lot of my colleagues teach with the tutorial hours,
1:55
so they have a full hour dedicated to work through exercises and the people walk into the room helping you out.
2:01
I, I'm not one of those people I, I teach and then I stop for exercises.
2:07
So I give you ten minutes to go through the problem and then I will come back.
2:15
You can discuss it, feel free to talk to each other on the on the chat.
2:19
I hope that other people, my assistant managing the technology that is supervised and then you can exchange
2:25
thoughts and talk to them about problems and we will help people as much with it.
2:34
So ask questions that while I teach, I don't really have an eye and time before or the check itself.
2:39
I'm going to look at it afterwards. So don't ask me questions that if you have a direct question for me, please interrupt me.
2:46
Just absolutely no problem with that. And I will try to do the two questions as well as I can.
2:54
Yeah. So. So the there are many good books available on the topic of what I teach in the libraries are full.
3:00
There are also very bad books. I haven't listened to those, but I have actually advanced on a book on this most.
3:16
But as far as my was concerned, the last bit in particular, although this person doesn't really treat the topics of the of the course,
3:25
it does three different philosophy of what I think is a very good thing to read,
3:33
because he very clearly discusses what is needed to do mathematical reason.
3:40
Much. So I'm going to do this in this couple of weeks.
3:52
It's the first of all. Today we will look at mathematical proofs of mathematical reasoning.
4:05
I'll talk it through what I mean by that. Afterwards, we will look at the assets and how they're defined, etc., and then we will look at relations.
4:11
And that's defined as a subset of the combination of assets.
4:23
And we don't look at orderings kind of relations and we look at functions which again, are a special kind of relationship as well.
4:29
And then I will finish by looking at cardinality, which is, I think the more interesting because of this course,
4:41
because it looks at this point to take a different if it's a very interesting topic, as I've said, I've had to condense my material.
4:51
So I don't know if I will go for everything. That depends on how fast you can cook.
5:03
So the first thing that I want to discuss with you, this is what's going to happen today is what is a mathematical proof now.
5:13
And the I felt after teaching for a while,
5:20
the need to make this very explicit because students are confused to come from a background where doing mathematics is mainly solving equations.
5:26
You're taught to manipulate formula and you help me with numbers.
5:40
And so what you write down is let's say that the real work you're working on this normally doesn't constitute.
5:45
So if you write down your reasoning and every time you use your reasoning, you have a mathematical exquisiteness.
5:57
The only thing that you write down, I mean, you don't find your reasoning down, then it's just a sequence of expressions is not a proof.
6:05
So I'm going to try to make it very clear today what is actually a proof so that there is no confusion.
6:12
So first of all, accept the concept is that it is a very carefully constructed reasoning.
6:21
Yeah. And the point of this reasoning is that the it is a sequence of steps and steps are important.
6:28
So what are the steps that you are allowed to make in the reasoning? That's the thing.
6:39
That is the focus of today. So if you have a sequence of steps to improve, then all the intermediate steps.
6:43
I have to be true as well. Yeah. So you want to be the conclusion to be clear.
6:53
You want to think it started to get true and everything which was suggested, that's the thing.
6:58
Or you go from to exhibit. So but the point is, when you when you write down the proof officially,
7:04
everything that you write, you have to justify every single statement that you make.
7:13
You have to give approval.
7:18
And then you can step back and say, OK, that's going to be an enormous amount of work and how much detail I must put to good.
7:20
For example, do I need to prove that A is an equal number?
7:27
So I hope today will clarify that.
7:33
So first of all, prove a mathematical reasoning is the proof is in mathematical reasoning that follows only a certain amount and steps and the.
7:38
So this is very important that you use the steps and do not use anything else.
7:54
It's like it's like a programming language.
7:59
So you you cannot in your computer programme write an English sentence and then hope that the computer can make the same thing.
8:01
It's like like coding. You have to compose proof out of the tools available.
8:10
So this means, for example, that insight itself is never a particle.
8:17
So you can you can never open it.
8:22
Well, clearly, it has to be the case that that's that's not a part of the don't the suggestions and hope that we know when we are.
8:25
But I'm going to discuss the steps that allowed abstracting from what what we actually prove, because it's only composed of the steps.
8:38
No. One. The other thing that improving and I will give examples of things to prove what's happened today.
8:45
So first of all, we have we are dealing with statements. So we are.
8:54
Showing that a particular thing we are saying is correct and the things that we are formulating is a statement and a collection of statements,
8:59
I think of seven in total. So in a statement then the this is a statement as well.
9:09
So obviously it is very easy to use for this now.
9:17
But in the notes, I use a different form. And I also used the back quote and the quote.
9:21
So this is the the isolation of this is so this is how I wrote the statement to make sure that, you know,
9:27
what his statement and the words talking about it so that, by the way, I forgot to mention this sort of extensive notes on this on my contribution.
9:34
Please work from the notes. Google depend on the slides because the slides are just a summary of the notes.
9:49
You compare them and exercises, please. The on the notes.
9:56
So we saw, for example, I am allowed to say to you and you are through.
10:02
Yeah. So the statement is true. If I have shown that both B and I have approved for Q, then I can say I have a good answer.
10:08
If the combination of those two improves that makes, then I can say, for example, that p o u.
10:21
S from A. I've been pretty good for P or I have improved you or both, so it doesn't matter.
10:31
But one of them is enough now.
10:38
So if I if I have that both through, I do not need the combination of the proofs to show people who I just pick whatever I want to use,
10:43
because some sort of show that the accused I chose that need to have a group of people who I can either prove or not be,
10:53
if I if I can show that this is false, I will stop.
11:04
We will see how we do that. Now, this is the tricky one in all the and all the reason.
11:09
This is one that soon after the more difficulty with this, the implication and this is true.
11:16
Yeah. When the when whenever a plea is true, then so this is a relation between the truth of two statements and the sense that if it's true then.
11:23
So what happens if this falls? Well, as long as it's true, it's still OK, because it doesn't say that if it is false,
11:40
then he has to be false as well, but only says that if this is true, then his vigilance.
11:49
You know, that statement is used for all statements now,
12:00
and this statement is true whenever I can show that it is true, irrespective of which object, I pick fights.
12:04
So this is a formula that contains as an opposition, I can feel the gobshites.
12:19
And if I can, for all the choices, argue that that holds, then I can say that this statement holds forever x.
12:26
Anderson's statements first, and that is, if I can say that this statement is true,
12:37
if I can find one particular element that is true for that particular.
12:45
So I don't need to show it for many months. OK, so this is the these are the building blocks of our statement.
12:52
So you can you can see it. They can replace bay by boat something else which has been before, as in a programming language.
13:00
So this is the year that the six cages in the yard.
13:08
OK, so how do we build process with this? Well, the process is correct.
13:13
Yes. Yes. So I, I have a question about this.
13:20
Is this a complete list of like statements were or not?
13:24
So it depends on what you mean by complete.
13:32
It is the every thing that you want to write down in mathematics can be brought back to a combination of these six.
13:35
Now, for example, if and only if explosive or not, all these things can be expressed in this book.
13:44
And so we cannot write anything else except this.
13:54
Yeah. So you can bring all I mean, you can even do it with less.
14:00
I think you can. For example, you can you can take out the end in the hall and then there's still complete, you can still encode everything.
14:04
So these four other enough as well for the purpose of the course we take these six other these let's say the elementary ones,
14:13
you can enrich them, but it doesn't really change the difficulty. I hope you understand what I'm saying.
14:21
So there it is. It's complete in the sense that it is enough. OK, thank you.
14:27
But there are many you can. OK, so first of all, what are the steps that we are allowed to make?
14:33
Well, there is one thing that is called the assumption. The answer, a step allowed to make it proof is that you assume that something is true.
14:39
And then, of course, you assuming it is it is true.
14:47
So if and so that's a very easy answer.
14:52
There's nothing happening. And then the answer, if you use this in a crosstab, then you would write down in words.
14:56
And this is very important. And so this is how you arrived on the proof now to assume people shouldn't be used.
15:07
So this is a representation of the poor.
15:17
There's not a formula itself now with this sentence is just this is the No.
15:22
So not just that we do not show that piece. True. Not because we don't know that, but just assume that this.
15:28
Good. So how do you show the P and Q holds?
15:38
Yeah, well, as I've suggested before, you have a four feet.
15:44
You have to prove and you have to prove, OK. So that's how you show that being used.
15:49
So an example of how that would work is so you have here this because is Lipsitz indicate the proof
15:57
would be this in case of proof for Q So and have a structure that it's just been instructed.
16:04
Q And then I add the sentence since both which we have to be answered,
16:09
considers the extension of the two groups of people, that makes the new performance, so to speak.
16:16
And independence is not nothing additional than they, but they are both needed in this construction.
16:25
And on the other hand, if I, I can't go back.
16:33
So if I have the information that comes through, then I know that both are true.
16:37
So I can now construct a proof for people to construct a pool cue from the fact that I and I do that as follows.
16:42
So this is my proof for being you now and then at the sentence then, and I can do this.
16:52
So from a proof of point, you you can have a piece by saying, OK, you extend the.
17:01
And so so so we know to be true because we have the proof it can still exist and therefore both components, if true,
17:15
even if you have just assumed it, just so it can be that we have shown because we have a consumer with the previous death.
17:25
But it might have been an assumption and then we don't know where the proof comes.
17:33
OK, so in showing or it's fairly straightforward as well in the sense that it's if you have to prove that is true,
17:39
then you can extend it and saying don't be OK, OK, I can do the same thing for.
17:54
It does not matter which of the show in the sense that sometimes the you know,
18:06
the the the situation forces you and they can only show pain and not you.
18:14
But it doesn't matter in the order of these two statements, which is the component is the first and second.
18:20
Doesn't the. When you are using your cell phone, especially if you have or an assumption, how do you deal with this?
18:27
What is what is the proof of power that statement or gives you?
18:40
Well, this is what we call the proof cases. So we if we know that was true because of the construction of the previous case, we don't know which one.
18:45
This is the one that is. So but we need to show you something.
18:56
Doesn't matter. Yeah. And in the sense that we will show the proof that users want to go through the construction and say,
19:01
OK, no matter which only is going to be fine because we caught the result.
19:10
And the so the one of the all cases, the local school, the middle of the street, so.
19:16
To prove that uses or has the proof or the assumption that people are now,
19:25
you assume being and then you have the reasoning that goes to the conclusion
19:32
that Arveladze and then you have another reasoning that assumes Cual again,
19:37
you also have the balls. Well, if this is true, this proves to prove so far, I'm assuming you have information,
19:43
including Devar, then it doesn't matter which one of the accused is going to be true.
19:52
Yeah. So this is a this is a very extensive sort of tree support involved here.
19:58
There's the proof. You must have proof for our A to be accused of proof of insurance.
20:05
And then you extend those reports saying then ask.
20:13
OK.
20:19
So we have shown that our holds, irrespective of the fact the history of Cuba is going to be the one that holds up, even if the boat wasn't so good.
20:25
But I need the fact that in these two cities, these are two states.
20:36
And so this is the case that peaceful this is the future I need and this proof
20:41
that the conclusions are identical and they have to lead to the same conclusion.
20:47
I will also come up with. OK.
20:53
Good. How do you how do you build the pool?
20:59
And that's that is going to be the notion of contradiction.
21:05
So you go to something so you as a human being and you get something which cannot hold this kind of picture.
21:09
So if that is the case, if you have any proof like that, then you'll meet a contradiction.
21:17
And the course of action is impossible due in mathematics, in the proof system that we have, it is impossible to prove a contradiction.
21:23
So it means that if you are proving a contradiction, you have assumed the wrong thing.
21:32
So this you have to reject one of your assumptions and which one you reject doesn't matter.
21:39
It's the combination of two of the assumptions that that makes the conclusion.
21:44
So if you are a human being and you reach the contradiction, then you have to reject the assumption and you have to say what is not true to know,
21:50
and therefore you can say that you have not reached a conclusion.
22:01
So this becomes the proof that this assume beholds and then you have the proof for contradiction and then the sentence been not convinced.
22:06
OK, so this is that this adds this prefixes the not and for.
22:20
The implication is a way in which you can eliminate an assumption so you have assumptions in your reasoning that at the certain point people to say,
22:30
well, I don't want this to be an assumption anymore, I'm going to incorporate in the thing that I'm pulling to the implication.
22:45
Yeah. So if we can prove conclusive proof for.
22:51
Q Yeah. And we have an assumption in that proof,
22:55
then we can reason that if beholds then calls and B so we b the through the construction of the proof of defence will be.
22:59
We can argue that if it's is true then because all the assumptions are supposed to be true and we have a proof structure that preserves the truth.
23:14
So the we start at the end of the case. So in this particular instance, it's related.
23:25
Yeah. And if that is the case, so I reserve this phrase for approved.
23:33
It has passed as an assumption now and then. This is the case since the conclusion of that proved successful is no longer an assumption.
23:41
The statement that I'm showing. No, it's not. Q But the statement that I'm sure is put in place and sort of confirms that.
23:49
Q With an assumption for P two statements has been in place.
23:58
Q and B now it no longer is an assumption. So if it's not true then what does that say about.
24:04
Q Does that mean? Q is also not to be considered if B isn't allowed.
24:12
B is an assumption all the sanctions are supposed to hold.
24:18
Now, if you run the contradiction, then that's that's a different case you can reject.
24:23
But at the moment, at this particular stage we have approved for Khuda depends on and therefore we can say that the
24:29
implants and we have assumed to be true and we have not long the competition after P implies.
24:36
Q You cannot reject P anymore because is no longer an assumption.
24:44
People disappear. That's an assumption, so it's not one of those that the answer,
24:55
if you continue the proof and you have been persecuted in your book and you encounter a contradiction later,
25:00
you can't go back and reject people because it disappeared. This assumption because of Mr.
25:07
Exactly. So you're saying feet will always be drawn to U.S. and that case can never happen?
25:17
No, I'm not saying that we can be fools, but it is it is not the case that we can we can.
25:24
So be it is an assumption. Old assumptions are assumed to be true.
25:33
If it is or not, that's not the case. Now, in this in this construction, if peace holds true or false,
25:42
is not an issue because the implication is that market before doesn't depend on the implications.
25:50
But in this particular situation, we have assumed to be true.
25:56
Thank you. So the proof is suggested by the Pentagon before works like this, so you have an assumption,
26:04
Poppy, and you then proved that two holes and then you can add to a sentence that P implies.
26:15
Q And as I said, B is no longer shown to be true.
26:24
So it is no longer an assumption because it's now part of the statement that you.
26:30
Now, this, again, is the answer to the question before us.
26:42
So if you want to use the implication, so this means that it says that P implies Q assuming it's true, eventually it was true.
26:46
Well, if we now can show that for long so we don't we don't need to ensure that there can be no excuse for without precondition,
26:58
without without the dependency.
27:10
So if I have A proof B and I have a proof of premium price, then there's these two together and I think the sentence forms of proof.
27:13
So remark here that if you look at the structure of this of this proof,
27:29
there is no proof for Q And those pupu is not proven independently without using big noncanonical P is still in there.
27:35
But these two steps together are considered to be.
27:44
So you have to be in close. Q And you have to prove what they say.
27:50
Aha. Then. Q I saw this one. I accept these two construction.
27:54
Q OK, I can make this into the proof for Q But I have to manipulate the proofs.
27:59
So but it's not the issue, the issue at this particular moment, at this step,
28:08
at using pretention allows you to combine to produce and say OK, and I have proof of the pudding thing on the right hand side of the class.
28:12
Again, implication is the tricky bit in this and construction student struggling with it.
28:24
And I think the question about the show, P or Q if you're trying to show P, Q Is it enough to just prove one of P or do you have to prove both.
28:32
But no. Explicitly said on the slide that you can pick one for and you need to have both.
28:43
OK, thank you. So if you have a proof of both and you pick just the one that you know.
28:52
OK, now, so far, this is all been very straightforward, very intuitive,
29:00
but this is the mathematics needs things that you can actually discuss and say,
29:07
well, I don't actually know if this is sound, but in normal mathematics, what I'm discussing here, this is accepted because people who don't know.
29:12
So, for example, the what is called the law school that says that every mathematical statements are
29:23
everything you write down in in in the formulations that I introduce you to a six.
29:29
Everything you write down either through course.
29:36
So this means that people will not be it's always true, irrespective of which I think and this is this is very,
29:39
very strong and powerful thing, because how do you verify this particular statement?
29:48
Well, as we've said before, whether or demands you have a proof copy or you have a proof or not.
29:54
And this is not always the case. There are mathematical statements that you can write down for which you don't have a proof, neither for Panopto.
30:02
I know to come up with that, that they know it's do we know that people know history and the mathematics test?
30:09
Yes. Because we assume we accept that every statement.
30:19
Again, it's a very powerful tool, not a not accepted by all mathematicians, but it is a reality.
30:25
OK, so again, because this is dealing with the oral statement, if you use the law, here's the middle.
30:34
You have proof of case. There is a proof that could prove a contradiction.
30:41
And this is like the laws for the middle. And this is a proof that the System B holds, because it cannot be true that it does not.
30:49
So the proof in this construction says assume that that nothing holds up and then you have to prove to us a contradiction.
31:00
OK, so they have a negative assumption. If you go to a contradiction and the conclusion this proves that is, then.
31:12
So notice that we would have said by the not the the showing not step that you would conclude that would be useful.
31:22
And a lot the middle you can argue that will be the same.
31:34
So again, this is a a rule that, of course, that that eliminates consumption.
31:42
So if you make this, then you say, well, if I'm not, go to the contradiction, that piece from piece, not just the big assumption.
31:52
OK, here's another step again. You can argue if this is a valid thing to do.
32:05
The point is that the a contradiction should not be provable because if you have a contradiction, then anything for anything goes.
32:12
If you have because everything becomes no. But you can argue in terms of having to set them up again in the context of dealing with it.
32:22
OK, so this means that you have to prove that goes to conviction than anything else.
32:31
So you think you've been a pretty big of. No, some gets cancelled because the wounded soldier, the last four,
32:39
approves that deal with the qualifiers and we have to start the shows for every X the property deals.
32:55
And the statement normally goes like, take and I would object.
33:07
Yeah, I will see you later. There's going to be said for the moment, it's just a thing.
33:14
So you have a universe of objects and you take an arbitrary.
33:19
So this means that, for example, when you deal with numbers, you can't say take an arbitrary number, take two to knock them out.
33:24
No, no. You can sit and you can say they cannot with no end.
33:33
And then you work with and from then on because then you don't know what it is
33:39
you're going to show to both of you at the moment then and then at the end,
33:43
you can say, well, I didn't pick an arbitrary and because I don't know which I'm doing that and therefore what I hope for all I know.
33:47
So this structure that we have. So you start with an arbitrary object and you prove that property peoples with a particular object.
33:54
And now if the proof construct is independent of which.
34:07
Oh, you're with. Yeah. Then oh. So this object was truly arbitrary.
34:12
And then we have that piece of rules for every for every now and therefore we can say that a property P of X holds five weeks.
34:19
So for every element that you want to put into the open positions control.
34:32
Yeah. So if you have a group for people for an arbitrary.
34:37
Oh then yeah. You can say then X holds for X.
34:41
Sorry to interrupt. So I'm a little bit confused why we need to use another variable o because we already have X X because the X is not an object,
34:47
X is a placeholder, X is an open position in the formula. OK.
35:01
So, so for example n the character and that's not an actual number.
35:09
Numbers are one, two, three, four, five and separate and there's not the number and there's nothing that's.
35:17
OK, yeah. I know, I know it's confusing, so but the point is the the the SoBe, the X, so the X is part of the formula.
35:24
So you can only quantify over the physical, the variable. And this is this is.
35:40
So you take an arbitrary control. You don't take valuable to prove things will be taken out.
35:48
So it says something like we cannot prove something like Varrick every X, we can only prove our facts.
35:55
And that exists all. And we saw that support for any kind of oh, it can't be correct.
36:03
So the whole thing is cracked. Is that right?
36:09
The I have difficulty understanding you.
36:14
What I'm saying is that the so did the statement that I have has a variable in there and the variable is a place where you can put in an object.
36:18
Yeah. So, um, so X is not an object.
36:34
X is a place where you can put an object.
36:39
So if I want to prove that beholds for all the objects, I have to take an arbitrary object and show that it goes to the doctor,
36:41
then I can say the statement reacts to the experience holds that statement becomes
36:49
true because I have shown that beholds with put an object into the value.
36:56
OK, maybe I got the point. OK, thank you. Now on the counterpart, you can use the full statement from the X and the assaults.
37:04
If we know that we have a proof that it is a complex, then we have to approve the statement.
37:18
And I know that O is an object that can be used for X, then I can conclude that people.
37:25
So if I have a proof for this and I have to prove that O is an object, then I can say.
37:32
Could.
37:45
There exists a similar but different, so you showed the existing Exocet being sold by, for example, showing that taking a hold to be just difficult,
37:49
for example, in this case can deal with numbers you can say take and to be to be to know if that was the one that works.
38:06
So you can take a specific element in this step in the collection and put that on hold for them.
38:15
And then you have you can conclude that the sentence still exists in Exocet because you have the evidence.
38:22
OK, well, you want to use the this particular sentence, then you know that there is an acknowledgement for that.
38:32
You can pick this and also people pick one, which is going to be true even if you do not know which one it is.
38:47
So this is a very useful instrument. And when you're doing proofs and so if you know that there exists an element, then you can say, OK, let it be OK.
38:54
And then you say from the moment the case, the wonderful fields go on just like that.
39:06
OK, so. So this means that I do not know I might not know what oase, but I do know that it exists.
39:13
But this is where mathematics is is not constructed. Yeah.
39:25
Because a construct of mathematics this sentence means that you know which extra taxes.
39:29
But as a matter of fact because we are dealing with negation and not of middle,
39:36
you can find yourself in the situation that we have approved for to exist without knowing which one is.
39:42
Yeah. So sometimes you get this conclusion without doing the response first.
39:48
OK, so things you are not allowed to do in a pool.
39:58
Yeah, so for example, you cannot say it is easy to see if it is really easy.
40:04
But again, you cannot say it has to be the case that it was not correct.
40:10
That statement is either true or not. It doesn't have to be in symbols like the double arrow.
40:17
I said these symbols can only be used in formulas.
40:26
Yeah, this is very, very, very, very important. This is the thing where you lose Moggs in the exam.
40:30
OK, if you are you come from a culture where you allow your teacher allowed you to ride the symbol for any and or if you wanted to,
40:37
if it should be using the word and and it allows you to ride the double arrow, then you should be writing the book then of implies.
40:48
You know, I do not accept from any of you the use of symbols when you should be writing a word.
40:58
No is just very important. You have to distinguish what it is that you are proving.
41:06
So what are the statements that you're proving in which you can use symbols and what is the proof?
41:12
That is the reasoning that you use in the reasoning that you use.
41:17
You cannot you know, it's like using a Chinese character in an English sentence.
41:21
It's it's makes no sense. This very important.
41:27
Please, please remember that you lose marks if you use this incorrectly.
41:33
It's like like writing a python keyword in the C programme.
41:39
You know, it doesn't compile. You have to see me as a compiler.
41:43
If you do not write down syntactically correct answer, I'm going to take away marks.
41:48
OK, this symbol in particular I hate now it is useful therefore.
41:58
Well if you want to say therefore you're right.
42:04
Therefore ok if this symbol on its on its it's its students used it as I see that but I've written that now leads to this.
42:07
Well that's, that's not true. It's not a Two-Step, it is an insight.
42:19
And as I've said before, inside of parts of the proof steps are possible.
42:26
So this is now the point that just with making the writing improves very much like writing computer code.
42:35
So please bear in mind that you cannot just do what you like.
42:50
OK, good. So in this framework.
42:53
Yeah. So we have assumptions and we have conclusions and we have steps that make us combine things that we have
43:00
be that we built the mathematical reasoning that we can ask ourselves in how much detail we need to go.
43:07
For example, we cannot just say that three plus four seven,
43:16
because that's a mathematical statement that it needs to be proven and there are ways to prove that.
43:21
But if I would insist on this level of detail, then you would never ask a question because it's too much work.
43:28
So I'm going to allow you a certain level of of of detail that you do not need to specify.
43:34
So. I I'm going to sign.
43:42
The yeah, so the proof is the the the factual checking of the correctness of all the Indonesian statements to make
43:53
sure that the the truth of one leads to the intuitive reasoning is the the the inspiration for the problem.
44:05
Yeah. So you can understand that something is true and then say, OK,
44:16
and from that understanding you construct the proof, you see how you can only check them.
44:22
So if I ask you for proof, you cannot give in to this argument.
44:33
If I, if I ask you to argue, you can you can give me to them.
44:36
OK. So if I asked you for proof,
44:42
you have to be precise and follow the rules and new steps and the level of detail stops at what I call the basic things like arithmetic, for example.
44:49
So you would not need and wouldn't ask you to show this also because they don't give
45:01
you the tools in this course to do this because it's not part of the curriculum.
45:06
So certain things you can accept stuff that, you know, like, for example, for is any number.
45:12
You don't have to argue that. But all the all the construction of the statements in terms that we've used and only applies for,
45:21
frankly and exist and not, you know, those things, all the statements and those things you need to follow.
45:31
OK, good. So this is a it's 2010.
45:39
We're going to have a little break. Ten minutes and we will be back at at 10:00.
45:45
OK, go back to the second tower is going to be dedicated to examples, I hope,
56:08
to illustrate the workings of a the rules that I've presented to steps to acceptable, reasonable steps.
56:15
And they also will give you an example of what a proof should look like.
56:26
So this is very important, the composition of living.
56:34
So let's start with a simple example.
56:41
And I want to prove that if being so painful implies Q And of course, if you look at the at the interpretation of the statement,
56:43
which says that if the first part is true, then the second part is true as well.
56:54
Well if it was true, then of course that was true.
57:00
So there you are. So it's in a certain sense it's evidence.
57:05
And in mathematics, a lot of people would stop at this point saying, you see,
57:13
I have I've I've argued that this statement is true and therefore you can move on.
57:20
But this is what we're doing here, and that is not enough. I want the proof.
57:29
I need the reasoning of reasoning. Using the steps from what I've said so far is the insight in why this is true.
57:34
It is not the proof. So the proof would be constructed and is now very, very exclusive, giving all hold all the small details.
57:43
OK, so you can start to prove that you will see the people in reading doing this later in the course as well,
57:53
that they write down the goal of what the group needs to do.
58:01
So in this particular case, you need to show an application to understand the key with the highest.
58:05
And that is the implies. OK. And so what we need to do is we need to build the proof that says if this is true,
58:11
then that we've put this in the assumptions and we want to we want to to the fact that we can still do that.
58:20
So this should be income. Yeah. So that's now one of my assumptions.
58:30
So by the by the assumption, I know that that be used.
58:35
OK, so that's gonna be fine.
58:40
I know how I look at the key word there. And what can I do with an end statement.
58:45
I can, I can decompose it. I can pull one of them out and say that's the stuff that's on this floor.
58:50
So by using it, I know the accused. So what I have now is a proof that starts with the assumption of the Q and reaches the conclusion of.
58:56
So my my employees step now says I have a tool for the application now.
59:09
So assuming you can do so, you have to prove for people intrinsic.
59:18
So the proof is not just the deposit in green.
59:26
The the the truth is the full text. This is the proof.
59:32
So it's very important that you realise that there's a law of English and you will need that logic.
59:38
See, I got the use of the of the word proof where they do symbol that they place.
59:44
And that is fine in the context of logic, but in the context of mathematics, just.
59:53
Yeah. So proof is not a manipulation of performance.
59:59
The proof is the reasoning in English over statements.
1:00:03
But so I've mentioned the steps, and I recommend you do that,
1:00:10
because then you especially when you when you want to look back at your work at a later moment in time,
1:00:17
for example, when you're revising,
1:00:25
it's very important that you write down the steps so you can reconstruct truthful if you do not write down the steps is more difficult.
1:00:26
OK, but not always so many things. That's good about this particular thing now.
1:00:34
So we have the same thing in the so we have three implies here.
1:00:42
You have to do one at the top and we have on the left of this top on the right.
1:00:45
But the same state. Yeah. So this again is intuitively immediately evident.
1:00:51
You know, if this is true then that this is the same thing. Yeah.
1:00:58
But this is not OK. So I'm going to show you two different ways of proving this.
1:01:03
The first one, of course, is what I want to show that P implies.
1:01:10
Q So how do I show an application? Well, I do that by assuming P.
1:01:16
So I need to show P implies Cuban and she'll be in class.
1:01:25
OK, so because that's what the first implies means I'm going to show this is the implication.
1:01:29
I, I look at the step that says how do I show one implication and it says well you have to assume P and then you need to go to Cuba.
1:01:35
OK, so it should be and we need to be the proof.
1:01:44
OK, so we have two assumptions now. We have to do something.
1:01:48
Brunskill We have an assumption p and and by using implies I now know that you know, so I have a proof for that.
1:01:52
Q is true under the assumptions that are being prosecuted under the assumption.
1:02:04
OK, therefore I know that I think one assumes I can pick the other one as well,
1:02:10
that there is no rule in which assumptions are used in using plausible.
1:02:16
But I'm working towards a formula. That's my goal. So that's what I want to show.
1:02:23
So I'm building that from the outside and eliminating some people.
1:02:28
So I'm building up the statement people can.
1:02:33
Q I know I have only one assumption that this one that I know and now I do the same thing
1:02:37
again so I could build the problem lies with this conclusion and it's an assumption.
1:02:44
So I end up with the statement that I wanted to prove and I have no assumptions.
1:02:50
OK, that's the other process.
1:02:56
Well, I have the same formula on the left and the right, so perhaps I don't need to make it too complicated.
1:03:01
I just assume Pretium plus Q Then by assumption p inconsequent is true.
1:03:07
Yeah.
1:03:14
Good market I I'm not good on the steps, so I have an assumption, at least in conclusion, and therefore I have no opinions about the truth as long.
1:03:14
OK, so I'm not saying that the proof has to be complicated.
1:03:31
I mean, the inside that this is true is very, very closely related to the actual representations.
1:03:35
The proof. But the inside is not the proof.
1:03:42
That's the only thing that comes. The understanding that something is true is not the same thing as proof that something.
1:03:45
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.
1:03:56
I'd like to know if that was legal before the step by step government, for example, in its just work, we have to sorry, we have to vote for the steps.
1:03:58
Do we have to follow the steps? It's it's it's it's you don't have to but it is better for yourself.
1:04:09
I'm not doing it easier because of the lack of space on the slide, but I think so.
1:04:16
I mean for yourself and for others can afford to, to show that you that you did.
1:04:22
You know, if you're doing that, you understand what you're doing.
1:04:30
If you're right on the steps, it's very clear. If you don't write down the steps, we we sometimes I sometimes think the student is getting.
1:04:34
Me, understandably so, in the end, you work, it is recommended that you write down the steps sorry, the other student.
1:04:43
Hi, excuse me. In the proof that you have just shown, are we expected to know this first method?
1:04:52
Because from what I understand, as long as we assume the left hand side to be true, we do not need to actually prove the left hand side to be true.
1:04:59
We can just assume that it is true. And and and then from there, extend the proof for the right hand side, the OK.
1:05:08
So thank you, God. Did you ask the question as if you are thinking about what you are supposed to know?
1:05:16
And that's a valid question, but it's one that I discourage because this is about knowledge, not about marking.
1:05:29
First of all, the second thing is the both proofs are valid.
1:05:37
And this is the thing that I want you to understand from this slide. They are both correct proofs.
1:05:42
So this this is an illustration of the fact that you are many ways in which to prove a particular statement.
1:05:48
There is not a unique path now.
1:05:56
So that's that's the main thing here. If I'm asking you to prove the statement and you give me proof, number two is perfectly OK, because it is.
1:06:00
All right. Thank you. But the first proof shows you that if you follow so the first proof follows the structure of the statement.
1:06:10
Precisely. Yeah. The second proof steps back and say, oh, really?
1:06:18
That thing on the left and the right. So I don't need to do something as difficult.
1:06:25
But the sort of first proof is more methodical because it follows the statement and the second process.
1:06:31
Well, actually, I can do both of them. Thank you.
1:06:37
Yeah. So that assumption is made when you need it.
1:06:43
So for example, when you are decomposing in the application, you put things in your assumption collection and the assumption is an assumption.
1:06:48
So I said he exists. Yeah. Until it's cancelled in the in the in the U.S. implies that there is no longer an assumption.
1:06:59
I may have another question, of course. So could we introduce another variable, say ah.
1:07:09
Which means the same as P. Q to obtain like a simpler form of the statement we want to prove.
1:07:16
So you want to prove our employers are. Yes.
1:07:25
Where R means P implies. Q So it's essentially the same as to.
1:07:29
But I want to know how we go about formally introducing the variable.
1:07:34
You don't you just show for all statements are R implies.
1:07:39
Ah yeah. And the particular instance of is being applied.
1:07:45
Q OK, thank you.
1:07:49
Yeah. And it proves that our employees are that this proof that that's the second proof.
1:07:53
Yeah. You see that. Yep. So it makes it a little bit more tricky.
1:08:02
Yeah. So this is the classical logic steps and so can I show that if people ask you then not not to imply.
1:08:13
So let's look at the understanding of the statement. So this says that if preist then Keuchel, OK, which means that if Q is false,
1:08:26
then P has to be false because everything is false and P is well then plus the picture now so that they can know so intuitively.
1:08:37
This is correct. Now so how do we prove it.
1:08:49
Well again, so the unique, important thing is we work with the employment in the not to the constructor now.
1:08:52
So it is not always possible because sometimes you have to be a bit more creative in your new formula handballing.
1:09:01
But at this point it's the statement guides us in the construction.
1:09:09
Yeah. So we'll be able to show this, that we have this implication.
1:09:15
So we assume not.
1:09:21
Q And we need to show not only the assumption that we have that being OK, that's the information we get from the first information and then we say,
1:09:22
well actually I'm so you shouldn't do things and now I need to show not be so the goal of.
1:09:34
So we have the assumption both people and we have consumption being in place and we need to show not so I look back again to my to my steps.
1:09:46
How do I show them the people I need to shoot me and we need to go to a.
1:09:56
So it should not be so.
1:10:13
Yeah, so the proof will not be is that you are assuming and go to a competition.
1:10:18
So that's I forgot to mention that there will be a Schumpeter's spell and hope to come to a continues.
1:10:24
OK,
1:10:31
so if I now use this information first assumption P and I have the assumption that P in class Q then I know by using implies that comes to us from OK,
1:10:33
so that's a good thing. But now we have a contradiction here.
1:10:45
So I guess the thing that I aim for and a lot to get, so this is the case of contradiction.
1:10:51
So we have an assumption that if not. Q And we have proof of these things are in conflict, it cannot be the case that things are both true and false.
1:10:56
So this is a conflict.
1:11:06
So that means that this reasoning so far, this whole block here is is a contradiction and therefore one of my assumptions has to be thrown out.
1:11:08
And of course, I'm clever and then throw out to be because that's the one that I want to go to.
1:11:18
So I reject the assumption and the present on the edit because these I've given I cannot change those two guns or not to actually being priced.
1:11:24
Q Are part of the exercise I cannot put in northern front does not belong to the one that I can put forth on that issue.
1:11:38
And here so I know not P is true and B no longer is an assumption.
1:11:48
So I have two assumptions, not you and being placed.
1:11:55
Q And I have to conclusion P so I can build this implication not to imply not be on the assumption that people.
1:11:59
So do we need to exactly remember these steps or is this. Yes, everything that's in the slides, everything is in the notes.
1:12:18
Everything I say during the last just everything I think when I talk to you is a general.
1:12:27
OK. Everything there's nothing in this course which is not part of the capital.
1:12:34
It's like it's like asking me, do I really need to know this, the conditional structure in Python?
1:12:45
Do I need to. Yes. Yes, you do. This is part of what? Teach.
1:12:52
And what I mean is, do we need to memorise each step or as you see, that it might be sort of over covid the exams have to be an open book,
1:12:58
the events that take place in the department, not without your book.
1:13:11
And if I ask you to give the truth, I'm not going to give you the rules.
1:13:15
You have to know. It's like your programme in high school, nobody gives you the syntax, it has to you have to notice something.
1:13:19
But. So another example, which is the counterpart of the previous one.
1:13:35
Yeah, so I now want to show it, if not you implied not big then being punched again.
1:13:45
If your reason for this, it it becomes evident to me is that it's not the food safety is still thankyous.
1:13:53
True. So if true is true, then no.
1:14:04
Q is you see it becomes more complicated here.
1:14:09
We will see that the. So you haven't the faintest.
1:14:14
I don't remember exactly how the information goes,
1:14:19
but we'll see the construction of the proof that we have to make a jump in the and the construction because we have to use the law a little.
1:14:24
Well and so we we again look at the formula.
1:14:34
We want to show that being plus. Q using the assumption that not, you know.
1:14:40
B OK, so I do that by saying, OK, we now want to prove Q from the two assumptions.
1:14:46
B and look, you know, OK, well these two assumptions do not interact.
1:14:56
I cannot click one to the other and there's nothing I can do to the implication once and No.
1:15:02
Q And the P on its own doesn't fit anywhere though.
1:15:07
So I have to be creative here. So and the only thing that I can do is to work with this formula is to assume not.
1:15:12
Q Because then I open up just a few.
1:15:21
OK, so I assume not you. Well does this give me full use using the second assumption and I'll get OK so I know I've made
1:15:24
way because now I have p assumed and not been proven and therefore I have a contradiction.
1:15:36
Yeah. So what is the thing that you reject.
1:15:43
Again, I cannot protect P or this one because they're different.
1:15:48
So the thing that I'm rejecting is not.
1:15:53
Q Yeah but if I reject taking a cute and normal so just not, not useful because I need to go to Q So I used to prove the contradiction step.
1:15:55
So therefore I says that leads to a contradiction and therefore I get that question.
1:16:08
It was a question we can't use that implies directly on both.
1:16:15
Sorry. On the second paragraph when you say notice that we can't use directly then we cannot directly use the implies.
1:16:21
Why is that the case.
1:16:30
Because the so the information that we have A proof of B and you have proof of molecule in place more so those two things don't click.
1:16:32
So the using implies as a proof of A and A proof that implies B so the the thing on the left implies and the one that's on its own should be the same.
1:16:40
OK, that's that's OK, that says I don't understand what you're saying, so I'm going to repeat them.
1:16:55
So the implies I mean, I'm tempted to open a window right here, but I'm to put.
1:17:04
So that implies the use of the implausible sense. If you have to prove a danger for to prove A implies B, then these two together give a proof.
1:17:09
Yeah. Yes. OK, so that Will says so when can I use the implies place for a while that if the information that I fixed it.
1:17:21
But it's a pattern so I should have something that proves a and as soon as somebody puts A implies B I do not have that,
1:17:30
I have something to prove B and I have something that does not prove B plus something else.
1:17:40
OK, I get that now. So these formulas don't fit the pattern of using in place, and so therefore I need to do something now.
1:17:49
So the only thing that I can do is to try to satisfy the assumption.
1:17:58
So you know that I know the nexus now.
1:18:03
So if something is not.
1:18:07
Q And because I have you already know it's not the case anymore, because I feel that you get the conviction and therefore I can say,
1:18:09
well, my assumption it was false is incorrect and therefore has to be true.
1:18:18
You see that I use the fact that you can either be true or false.
1:18:24
Yeah. So if it's not false, it has to be so.
1:18:28
Excuse me. Yeah, I guess if there's a contradiction, I can choose to cancel it and I can ask you,
1:18:36
your microphone is not very clear, so you have to speak more slowly. Oh, yes.
1:18:47
So if we get a contradiction, we're going to look at the same speech at the same speech, speak.
1:18:52
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So if we get a contradiction, we can choose which assumption we want to cancel.
1:19:01
Basically, yes. OK. Yeah.
1:19:08
So you're free to do that. But in this particular case, we are not free because this is what we need to show.
1:19:12
And so we are guided by. But in the construction of proof that you cancel an assumption.
1:19:24
Yeah. The collection of assumptions together causes the contradiction.
1:19:31
So one of them has to be has to go and you're free to choose.
1:19:35
But of course you have to choose wisely because you want to go to a particular proof of God.
1:19:40
Thank you. So we have seen here that the proof of contradiction and contradiction is needed in this part of the state.
1:19:45
Yeah, but it is not needed in this part.
1:19:55
Yeah. Here we have contradiction, but what we do is we do not instruction.
1:19:59
So we we are using not. So it is different kind of.
1:20:04
Excuse me. Go ahead. So it's like we have three assumptions and there is a contradiction and we remove one of the assumptions.
1:20:13
Wouldn't there be a case where the remaining two assumptions contradict as well?
1:20:22
Of course it's impossible. Hey, I was not I did not think said that cancelling one assumption solves the overall contradiction.
1:20:27
It's just that the process that allows you to make an assumption is consultation.
1:20:39
It depends on where you want to go and you approve. But all of this that you want to do, right?
1:20:47
There's somebody talking and I cannot hear anything at all. No use of your microphone is very low.
1:20:56
I'm very sorry that I can hear somebody speaking very softly, but I can't hear what.
1:21:12
OK, I'll continue. Before we continue, I just like to ask if the tables are considered proofs.
1:21:23
If what is what truth tables. You're asking a few tables are what are considered proofs.
1:21:33
No, no, no, no, no. That's the because.
1:21:43
So the proof is constructed out of the the I've forgotten how many 12 steps or so that have shown a little table is nothing to do with them now.
1:21:49
So Truth Table helps you understand that things are.
1:21:59
Now, it's a way of representing the truth of the formula. It doesn't represent the truth.
1:22:06
That is a big distinction, so it's a big,
1:22:13
big distinction between understanding and proving the truth table as an illustration of the fact it is not proof.
1:22:15
OK, thanks. Yeah. So we we did this one.
1:22:27
One more question. Yeah, go ahead. Uh, could we instead of assuming not you instantly assume.
1:22:38
Q Because then the implication, uh, the implication not like not.
1:22:45
Q is then false and false implies anything.
1:22:51
So the note implies not B is automatically true.
1:22:55
Yes, yeah, but the statement is, if this is true, then that is true.
1:23:03
Yeah. So if North Korea is true, then, look, the proof only shows things that are true.
1:23:10
And then. Yeah, but let me go back and understand.
1:23:20
The point is in the reasoning that North Korea implies not big assumption here.
1:23:26
Is that not true?
1:23:31
So if you assume it is true, then you can't assume the North Koreans, because then you are assuming your assumptions are in competition.
1:23:34
The implication. So again, here you're confusing, understanding, improve.
1:23:45
The understanding is that if you screwed and this is to be true as well.
1:23:51
That's true. But it's not a full. In the proof you used have not from.
1:23:54
OK, so it's not like the formal logic implication, which is true when that heard no, no, no, you're misrepresenting what I'm saying.
1:24:02
The logic and proofs have to share information that they're not the same.
1:24:13
Yeah, the implication to the proof says it's so if you have to prove and you multiuse implies then the assumption.
1:24:21
Yeah. The thing is, the latest has to be an assumption. And Dabby is true that it's the structure of the poop.
1:24:29
OK, so I was confusing that with logic, so that's why I started by saying that's the intuition and against the proof,
1:24:37
your intuition is correct, there's nothing wrong with that. But it is not a step in that step in the process.
1:24:45
The thing on the left implies is an assumption that was true.
1:24:52
OK, understood. Thanks. So if I want to make a little bit more interesting, I can do the stuff with the periphery now.
1:24:57
So for everything else,
1:25:10
we have to close kulaks if there is an assumption and then there exists the Y stuff that prewired implies still exists instead of Kucik.
1:25:11
OK, so this is a very, very interesting collection of statements.
1:25:21
So basically what I'm saying is I want to prove the last one and the other two are assumptions.
1:25:28
Now you see that. So this implies there's no ingredients.
1:25:37
I don't know the final step. And and it's an also this.
1:25:41
If then that's not it implies that. So the first two statements and green assumptions and the last one is the.
1:25:47
No. Although he might have done something different.
1:25:59
OK, so the words that I do do so this is a apology's correction.
1:26:05
Yeah, this is and should be. OK, so I want to imply I want to show that implication.
1:26:13
And we have one assumption and so on. Let's see how this goes.
1:26:20
OK, so we want to resume the second bit that exist.
1:26:24
So we shouldn't be the first one. There was just an axis of pixels.
1:26:32
Well, if that's our assumption, then I know that that thing exists and I can go now.
1:26:37
I don't know which one it is, but a note letter is one I would call nothing.
1:26:42
So I know that of good know and go for for every X we have that be excellent plus kulaks and second assumption.
1:26:48
Yeah. And because we can use for everything and it says that you can,
1:27:03
if you have an object that is off of the correct soil then you can use that in this particular statement.
1:27:09
So I have a view and therefore I know that people in class.
1:27:17
Q OK, because this is the way to troll for every books.
1:27:22
I'm allowed to instantiate the part here, the actual substate and by the things that would object to that.
1:27:28
OK, so now I have that period of ogles and I have to be of in place.
1:27:39
Q of OK so that's all great. And therefore I know by using by that kubuabola.
1:27:47
OK, so I have an object for which Q holds.
1:27:56
So therefore what exists is it's just that simple said so again he had this set now becomes a variable, you know, and this is a concrete object.
1:28:02
So I've proven that in existence of such a concept holds without actually providing the Z.
1:28:15
No, I haven't shown you good at this, too.
1:28:25
For example, I got I said out of thin air just by the fact that we had the other two assumptions that provided the existence of the.
1:28:28
Setting this question, what was the assumption at the very start? Could you just explain the statement and then start again?
1:28:46
Yeah. So the so the assumption is, is this statement that the implication is that.
1:28:52
Let me check. Yeah.
1:29:02
So the implication. So this is my main assumption, the implication.
1:29:06
And I'm sure with this one that. Yeah.
1:29:11
OK, and in order for me to show this implication, I need to assume the path is on the left and I need to show the parties on the.
1:29:17
OK, I need to prove who use this this assumption. OK, so I assume the parties on the left, you know,
1:29:32
there was this nexus of things and I need to show them since the access appearance and by
1:29:42
I should have used set the scene because I have not been consistent with my variable.
1:29:52
OK. Yeah, so they said, OK, I will update this flight to make sure that all the name was cleared because I used X everywhere,
1:29:58
but it shouldn't be used by that. It doesn't really matter to correct this, but it doesn't have to be.
1:30:09
OK, so the main statement is this implication here.
1:30:15
This is my assumption to prove the implication, I make this left hand path into an assumption not to do that.
1:30:20
And that particular assumption gets me the object.
1:30:29
Oh, that I can work with that object. O is used in this in the first assumption.
1:30:34
I fit it in that. So this gives me a of place because I have proof of rules by the the first to somebody,
1:30:41
by the the second assumption then and therefore by using implies I get the two forms and therefore I'm only consistent in the sentence.
1:30:50
Q So David, just 15 seconds. OK, so I have two assumptions here.
1:31:02
And so far my assumption is, is assumption there and this assumption then, OK,
1:31:10
I'm pretty distractable assumption by building the line between this assumption and his conclusion that based on this statement.
1:31:19
It's OK to be confused, because I think it's one of those things that you have to to try to reconstruct.
1:31:40
Yeah, so read the proof, turn the page and try to do it yourself.
1:31:46
And if you could stuck to the page over and do it again,
1:31:51
there is there is a certain rhythm and the reasoning here that you have to because you are possibly confused by the formula.
1:31:55
The reasoning steps are fairly simple.
1:32:05
The only thing is that you need to to see the structures to prove and that's the best thing to do that is this exercise.
1:32:08
Just try to do it yourself. Sorry to interrupt, Cahoon.
1:32:16
I have a question, but so like we say, for our acts, I mean,
1:32:23
the acts can be like it's a rough and dry facts we can, etc. So it's almost like within the raindrop or something.
1:32:30
No, no. So the statements are about objects.
1:32:43
Yeah. So the statement is, for example, you can a statement could be Frole and two times and it's even.
1:32:48
Yeah. And then and is never. OK, so but the statement is for all and I know two times and yeah,
1:33:02
so just the statement has a position, which is the one that is so I called this the variable.
1:33:13
So access the variable and the variable occurs in the in the statement.
1:33:22
And the thing is, the variable can be you.
1:33:28
If you have an object that is the correct kind, you can put it inside the statement and you get correct.
1:33:34
That's that's the thing we have you. So if you have for every X we have to be X, that means that you take an X Filipino.
1:33:40
Yeah. Which can be used for X pocket in the position.
1:33:50
Sometimes you can say, for example, I'm thinking about if he has it's like.
1:33:53
Oh right. Like for example if we have it. She had something like the square root of axis squirters enduro.
1:34:02
So in this case for our X X plus we like squirter than there are more like the pure self cannot exist.
1:34:10
So the fee that you're mentioning that there's the formula, a formula that uses square root and greater than zero.
1:34:24
So the key is that. I'm going to swap screen and I'm going to let me see if I can do that, we can do.
1:34:34
That mistake has been involved. There have been teams that have forgotten and.
1:35:00
Yeah. Every second, because it's I need to.
1:35:35
It's a very unresponsive, insists on cleaning things and nothing happens.
1:36:14
OK, so let's let's let's not try to get any more.
1:36:21
I have to disappeared. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so there's no apologies to teenagers, I wanted to switch to another screen and it doesn't.
1:36:30
OK, this is not unfortunately, Microsoft is not very good in building sports.
1:37:08
Yeah, so I thought that in the meantime, let me try to talk you through the answer to this complex life cycle.
1:37:25
It is absolutely not anything at all. I'm looking at spending this year, you know, the.
1:37:43
Good. So what you see now is a sheet of paper, correct?
1:38:12
Yes, yes. So the deed, the statement that we had was P of X is for NetSol.
1:38:20
And so the statement was full for every X screamed of thanks is great.
1:38:42
Is that so? Can I go back to the student to ask the question before?
1:39:00
Is that statement that you had in mind? Yes. Yes.
1:39:04
OK, so the song might be.
1:39:08
So this is your X. So did. So this is B no.
1:39:12
And B is for every X.
1:39:18
Q Thanks. The Q is Skrmetta.
1:39:26
Thanks. Gratings you. So when you say cute, doesn't help, doesn't exist to exist.
1:39:30
That's not the right thing to say here now.
1:39:40
So this statement might be false. No, it's not not to start with the correct statement.
1:39:45
The point is that for this statement to be true, I need to take any kind of X.
1:39:53
And so I think about and the national numbers I think about are I think about and what you're thinking about.
1:39:58
Yeah. So where where does it belong to?
1:40:07
So, for example, in in end, this is not true because not everyone, no one has a square in ah, this is false because all can be naked and yeah.
1:40:19
And plus in our process works in the positive rules.
1:40:35
This would be a good thing because every positive rule that you put in this form that says, yes, this is true.
1:40:39
OK, so I said something like we must make it exist before it can be true.
1:40:49
But if we can prove something does not exist, like it's still false.
1:40:56
No, I don't understand what you're saying. So the the sort of proof that we had is the relation between statements and sets of people statements.
1:41:03
And so if if you want to prove there exists.
1:41:12
X sort of acts of or for all X these two statements, not even one statement, they are different statements.
1:41:23
The truth of one is not in relation to the others. Yeah.
1:41:36
For example, you can if you have if you have the assumption for X, then you can prove that it exists.
1:41:39
But you cannot do the Coulters because these things, these things are not stop, stop problems of each other.
1:41:46
Now independent. And it depends it depends on where X comes from.
1:41:57
So if you take just the number one, for example, there's not a lot you can say about it.
1:42:03
OK, OK, good. So let's go back to what is the P X equals V mean.
1:42:08
Did I try to erase them because I started doing so?
1:42:22
OK, you. So see, what you just said is that she's only doing a certain domain.
1:42:27
Is that what you don't see? Yeah, yeah, it depends on of course.
1:42:38
Of course. The so the statement that you are showing depends on what that you're talking about.
1:42:43
So if you can talk about even an odd, for example, in the context of Real's makes no sense.
1:42:51
With more than. You understand what I'm saying, then, yes.
1:43:00
OK. Yeah, so do I.
1:43:12
So this is going to be something is happening, an event today that makes things a little bit trying to.
1:43:16
Well, I'm trying to go back to the law to do something.
1:43:33
OK, we'll come back to that because it's time to stop. We'll come back to the to the last song last to know the last example of the proofs on Tuesday.
1:43:43
The practise session will start next week as well.
1:43:56
I will have the exercises for that on the OK over the weekend.
1:44:03
So he has a to work on the whole, I will ask you to do some simple proofs using the steps.
1:44:08
OK, so he can exercise to answer any more questions.
1:44:17
So I'll put these on, get the exercise that they really do.
1:44:23
And this is a really simple one and you may have answered it before, but any time we use the word implies does not just mean whatever it is is true.
1:44:30
Did imply statement itself, so ableist, sorry, sorry, no applies as you as you mentioned, the word is, you know, so you ask about applies or implies.
1:44:42
No, I got it wrong. I meant what as assume any time we used the word is, does that mean whatever it is, it's have it.
1:44:55
But so did due the sanctions of proof, other things that you that you want to be true.
1:45:02
OK, thank you. So you don't know if the true but there are assumptions.
1:45:09
No. And if you can prove the assumption then through the using it implies you can remove an assumption that's no longer an assumption.
1:45:13
So if I have a proof for P and I have a proof of implies you go together, look for proof for Q, which no longer is an assumption.
1:45:23
I assume when they write, if then is that the same as implies it is.
1:45:34
It is it is in the realm of context. I try to use if then for proof that has if so, if you get a free then.
1:45:40
Q I want to use that for a proof that shows.
1:45:50
Q with an assumption. P But because you can go from an approval for a fee then to immediate proof of premium price.
1:45:54
Q In terms of does a proof exist for this statement, that's the same problem and also that that is used interchangeably a lot.
1:46:03
But in the context of this cause I try to use the F then for improved function and the implies for the statement.
1:46:14
If in fact if you're using proof by contradiction to prove.
1:46:23
Q and you prove that not he contradicts it, how do you how does that prove that it has a P has to be true to be true.
1:46:29
Because what is completely unrelated and whether it is true or false,
1:46:41
it doesn't matter if you go to a contradiction, the collection of assumptions creates a problem.
1:46:45
So what you do is you take one assumption and you say, well, this particular assumption,
1:46:54
that's the one that I think this is the one that does this makes everything.
1:46:58
And therefore I reject this. You might make your own choice then, so you might pick one that has nothing to do with the problem.
1:47:03
But the end the rule that says if you have a contradiction, reject the assumption.
1:47:14
It doesn't tell you which assumption to reject and just simply reject an assumption and of course, the wrong assumption.
1:47:19
Sorry, how would you know if you've got the wrong assumption that if you can't make the proof, will do what you want to do?
1:47:30
OK, you know, maybe a technical question, but is it true that false implies P for any P?
1:47:39
Uh, implicitly. Yes, but we don't have false in our language.
1:47:50
We don't. OK, now. But in the end is the contradiction.
1:47:56
This is what you're saying proofs is are we defining natural numbers from zero or from one?
1:48:02
So we have to make so people will come to the data.
1:48:17
That's not the issue at the moment, but the answer is we can't from the from zero.
1:48:21
Right, OK. OK, that's did they have a new election coming up?
1:48:28
Or something else today. I don't know, a special day today, so I stopped recording on.
1:48:38
