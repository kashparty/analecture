Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova

Everyone, and welcome to our lecturing take to represent a bit before we start,
0:02
I want to say that this lecture is split into two parts to make it easier to one's opinions.
0:07
So let's start with the first part. And that's a very simple question, why binary numbers?
0:14
Well, that is because computers process binary patterns, which means that we are going to have less zeros and ones to represent data in a computer.
0:22
We are going to need to code it as a binary button. And therefore,
0:32
the most important thing to represent numbers and characters is how to convert
0:37
them into binary and then how to convert binary patterns back into numbers and.
0:43
So let's start with the simplest possible, which is how we convert the decimal number,
0:50
which is the numbers we allow into a binary number, and there's three very simple steps.
0:57
The first now the first step is that we are going to take that decimal number and divide it by two to four binary.
1:02
And this is going to give us a caution and a reminder,
1:13
and then we are going to repeat this first step with a new caution until we get the caution that is zero.
1:16
Then once we've done this until getting zero precaution,
1:24
the answer of the binary representation is basically going to be taking all the remainder column and reading it on the top, the top level.
1:29
That's a very good example. A very simple example.
1:40
Sorry. So what we're going to see how to convert the decimal number ninety eight into binary,
1:43
so the first step is that we are going to take these ninety eight.
1:52
As I said, we divide it for two by two. We got the portion of forty nine and then the next step is that we take forty nine and again divided by two.
1:56
Abortion is going to be 24 with a reminder of one. And this is because, remember, two times twenty four is 48 and the number we are debating is nine.
2:08
We have a reminder of one.
2:18
Then we take 24 and further divided by two, which gives us a portion of 12 and a reminder of zero and so forth until we get to a portion of zero.
2:20
And in this case, a reminder of what?
2:35
The way in which we are going to have the binary resulting binary representation is by taking the remainder column and reading it,
2:38
whatever the result is, one one zero zero zero one zero.
2:46
And then if we want to go back into the decimal number from a binary number,
2:52
we are just going to take each of these beats and multiply it by two to the power of the position they have in the binary pattern.
2:58
This is position zero, one, two and so forth, until position six in this case, we are going to have one time to do the power of six.
3:09
That's why I'm at one time or five zero times to the power of four and so forth.
3:19
We add them all up together and that gives us the number 98 in base time, which is where we start.
3:27
OK, right now, we know how to convert to binary numbers,
3:37
and the next thing that we are going to learn as a stepping stone to other representations is how the optimal representation of works,
3:43
which basically is, remember, binary means base of two.
3:52
And in this case, we are going to use a representation with base eight.
3:57
And even though this is not used anymore in computers,
4:01
it was used in the past as a more convenient way to representing a long binary
4:06
value just because a really long string of ones and zeros just very inconvenient.
4:12
The two convert to a decimal to a binary Panopto number,
4:19
we are going to take this binary string that we have here, we are going to chop it up into pieces of repeats.
4:27
And why is that?
4:36
Well, that's because we need three bits to represent number eight, which is our base, and then we are going to have one zero one for the.
4:37
Like most part, and then zero one zero for the most part.
4:51
And you're like in decimal zeros in front of a number.
4:55
No, it doesn't change that number. We are not writing this zero down here.
5:01
Now we convert this into a decimal number, so one zero one is number five and then zero one zero is number two.
5:07
So we put them one after the other and together is number twenty five.
5:17
In Base eight. Now, of course, to do the other way around, we can take a Panopto number and convert it into binary.
5:23
We are simply going to take, in this case, three five seven in these eight.
5:33
We put them one after the other and then translate each of the kids into a cure.
5:39
Number seven is one one one, remember? This is because this is due to the power of two, which is four plus two to the power of one,
5:44
which is two, and then two to the power of zero, which is one.
5:57
We have them all together and which is four to one. And that gives us a.
6:01
Then four or five, we do the same, which is that one zero one and then four three one one and then put them all together.
6:06
And the result is one one one zero one one one one investor.
6:14
So now we know how to convert numbers, in fact, between any arbitrary base using decimal and binary as our check points to get to any other base.
6:19
And now we are going to go into the hexadecimal representation and again, this is used by programers to represent very long binary values.
6:34
And this is preferred or up to why? Well, yes, you guessed it right, because we need even less characters to write long numbers.
6:46
So it's easier to read basically. And still very computer friendly because it's easy to translate into.
6:55
So in this case, we have 16. Which means that we need for bids to do the of four, and therefore we need four binary digits in every hexadecimal digit.
7:04
So if we take a binary number, uh, like this one here, one zero zero one one zero zero,
7:22
we are going to start from the right side and make groups of orbit.
7:31
So we have one group here that is one zero zero one,
7:36
and then we translate it into number nine and then we have zero one zero zero, which translates into four.
7:41
So this binary number that we had here, when we write it down in hexadecimal, is going to be ninety four days, 16.
7:49
Now, if we want to do the opposite, go from hexadecimal or hextor short into binary, we do what we already know.
7:58
We take number eight translated into binary, which is one zero zero zero, and then we take number six, which is zero one one zero.
8:06
And then we got this. Put them all together one after the other. And this is the binary number that we get and that we get.
8:17
Now, to hear that all the numbers that we get when we take a binary representation into hexadecimal in all these examples we have.
8:26
Numbers that are. Massimo. But if we had, for example, one zero.
8:41
One zero. In this case, we cannot be presented in a visit anymore, single digit, so since we have 16 different values,
8:50
what we are going to do is have, you know, one, two, three, four, five up until nine, and then the next digit is going to be left out.
9:01
We are going to go from a letter eight to the letter F.
9:09
So just to compare in X, we are going to go, as I said, again, from zero to nine and then from eight 12.
9:15
In decimal, these would be numbers from zero to 15.
9:25
And in binary, we would go from zero to one one one one.
9:29
So generally, these are just to give you some names that you will see very often,
9:34
one bite is the name that we will use for a binary digits or two hexadecimal digits, because, remember, Hex is groups of four.
9:40
Then there is also the name of a word which corresponds to two bites or sixteen binary digits and four hexadecimal digits,
9:51
and then we have a long word, which is four bytes or 32 beats or binary digits.
10:01
Sometimes you will not see this named as a double word.
10:09
And finally, even though it's not on the table, you will also see 64 bids, which is what most competitors know,
10:15
what they use as their base number, which would be a device that is given the name of wetwork.
10:23
So if you look at the naming scheme, all their competitors started with only 16 bids and they called it the basic word.
10:31
Then they said, well, we are going to 32 to make that a competitor more powerful and be able to deal with larger numbers.
10:40
Then we said, well, what do we know? Well, let's just go with longer or double work.
10:47
And finally, when more recently computers made the jump to sixty four bids,
10:54
they just followed the same pattern and called it quarter because it would be just four times extended.
10:59
Right. So what we're going to see in the next part of this lecture is some data types of interest now
11:08
that we know how to convert numbers between decimal and binary and other bases like hexadecimal,
11:17
we will see how to represent integers both inside and also on a different lecture.
11:27
Later on, we will see how to represent real numbers, what's called putting points.
11:34
And we will also see how to represent text and characters, both in the second part of the lecture.
