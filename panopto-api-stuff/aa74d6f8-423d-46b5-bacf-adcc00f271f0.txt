Title: DM Oct 19 Lecture Recording
Category: Discrete Mathematics
Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 25/10/2021
Yes, we're getting it started, I want you to try for the first five minutes the exercises in the in the window that I've shared.
0:13
So it's an exercise from the notes exercise. Do it. So are you speaking?
0:21
I think I can't hear you, it's because I'm not speaking.
3:42
Good, so I've started already by by writing out the information and the thing,
4:47
the first thing that you need to do in an exercise like this, you have to translate the definition into and to how it is defined.
4:53
The reason to do that is the proof rules that we have.
5:00
None of them speak about said inclusion. And so they have no no power to use those those proof steps just on the notation of the subject.
5:05
So you have to translate it into the predicate, in a sense, what the statement and the statement is.
5:16
I should have put the quotes in there. So I need to think that I need to show,
5:22
which is that C is a subset of A union B because on this expression and the the two
5:27
things that are stated on the the F gets translated into the assumptions A and B.
5:37
Yeah. Let me quote him as well. OK, so the thing that I need to show is the first full statement.
5:43
So what is the technique for that?
5:52
You take an arbitrary element and you showed that holes for that arbitrary element in you say and therefore it holds for.
5:53
So we take an arbitrary element.
5:59
Let's make it easy. OK, so what do we know about this element?
6:04
By the assumptions. By Assumption A. Yeah, it is one of the things that satisfies the the predicate there.
6:15
So it is not emergency. So therefore, she is in a.
6:27
Yes, I write in and I should have written the aliment notation so important to me quickly corrected.
6:36
I yes, and. Yeah.
6:52
OK, so we have that there's an element of, hey, we need to show the in both A and B, can we show that second thing as well?
7:10
Well, we can. So BYB assumption be.
7:17
We have that see is not going to be so by showing and I have to see is an element of a and sees an element of to be so by definition of an S.
7:23
I have to see is in a small scene, so I see is an element of a intersection, B the.
7:56
This is true. For amphetamine value, which I see, so for all X in C, we have X is and A intersection B,
8:09
so Australia should follow follows directly from the two propositions that I'm given.
8:38
And so that's that's OK. So it's definitely up to convert that subset of Pigot and all.
8:43
Yeah. Yeah. Because it's defined like that. I'm officially already there.
8:53
But if you're looking at that it was just in case it was necessary.
8:57
So in 2012. You're right. You're right. Yeah. So I see is a subset of intersection.
9:02
Governor, that that's a good comment. But, you know, by definition, these things are equal.
9:11
So the you know, I'm replacing it with something that's the same.
9:18
OK, so how do you do part two? Well, it's very similar.
9:23
I'm not going to do the full proof. I'm not going to give you the instruction. Again, you have two assumptions.
9:27
So you marked them A and B, you start with taking error.
9:34
So the part are in the proof. This will appear as part of the stuff that you do in there.
9:38
So you take an element and and in the union, then you know that A is in A or A and B,
9:43
so you have two cases, A's and A A's and B, this will lead to agency.
9:51
This will lead to agency now. So you have agency and then you go, yeah.
9:58
So what it gets here is the structure of the proof is not the province, of course, but I hope you can fill in the words of all of the pictures.
10:05
Any questions with this sketch? It's clear what I'm doing here.
10:19
I have a question not about this, but about the sets of Simon on Kate, what's the difference between the questions with PMed t shirt, not the front.
10:28
Those are the ones that you have, Sandin. OK, thank you.
10:38
So we had the second part officially belongs to me, and then it belongs to see what you need to show.
10:44
The second part we're able to see again, because this is this is this is under the assumption.
10:50
So here you assume that is an element of a. So it is it is this does age an element of C does not hold by itself.
10:56
It holds in the in the context of assumed that it is in a.
11:04
So you're not there yet, you did the safe assumption of what you'd know for sure is that A's and A's and B C,
11:11
which is shown in both cases, is that you have the result no matter what what hall.
11:20
And so you don't know which one is true, which is saying in either case, I go to the same conclusion, which is that agency.
11:27
So therefore, you have to assume in the first case that DNA in the second case of AIDS and be devoted to the same conclusion,
11:34
so you can say at the end it doesn't matter which part is true.
11:42
I know that in either case, I go to Asia to see. So that's the structures to prove my case.
11:47
You don't know if you are in a branch of the proofer cases you have to resolve depending on the assumption if you come out of the proof.
11:53
My case is that the assumption has disappeared because it's a statement that's no longer the assumption here, but it is this statement that the clear.
12:02
I have a question. Sure.
12:18
So if we have surplus to a surplus to be, can we just say directly that by showing intersection we have surplus to a, you know, S.B?
12:21
You could if you have shown that showing you the secretaries of state proof and you haven't done that.
12:32
OK, yeah. So what you what you what you can do is you can make a little lemer for yourself, which is in scientific proof already.
12:40
And Dilema says that if Azem a nation beat an Asian and a intersection B are you proof that those are proven here, then you can use it later.
12:48
But as a general rule,
13:00
the only thing you can do in a proof step is the stuff that is formulated by the step and no proof that talks about the intersection.
13:03
Because in the problem for our party, where we need to do a lot of not going to talk about stuff that you still have to hand in.
13:12
OK. OK, good, so let's go to the slides now.
13:21
I need to switch the sharing.
13:33
OK, which ones is it? No.
13:47
So that's the one Chandrayaan window now beginning to saying, oh, theme's.
14:01
There you go. So this is where we left off on Thursday, so I want to continue from here.
14:36
Do you see that the one of the things that appeared on the previous slide has become an exercise now?
14:53
So the first part there, I've made it into being exercise rather than do it in the lectures.
15:00
And I've written to him to make sure that you are on the right path.
15:05
Good. So I'm just going in the wrong direction from this area.
15:13
Good, so there is this concept called cardinality, which gives you a measure of a set.
15:27
We can define it very precisely for finite sense, because that is just a number of elements that is in the set.
15:34
And we want the elements to answer in when we talk about the elements and said we always make sure that they're all distinct.
15:41
So we are not allowing any repetition in sets at all.
15:53
The so when you have a number of finite set, you can actually count the numbers.
15:59
It gives you a natural number as an answer. Yeah.
16:05
So for example, if I take to the set of all the vowels, it's cardinality is five five elements in there.
16:07
If I take the car analogy of a union, I have to be careful because I might have a repetition of elements on the left and the right in the sense.
16:17
Yeah. So I now have collections of vowels on the left in this union.
16:24
Right in this union. I notice that I have here to set E and A and I have to set an E, so it is of course the same set, the same element,
16:31
so written down differently, but it's the same set and he has to said, you know and and I said, or you.
16:40
So in this union there are only three elements. So therefore the car analogy is three.
16:47
You would if you would look at this and say, well, I just look at the representation of five different elements in there,
16:54
but it's not true because the two sets and they are represented, the commonality of the empty set, of course, is zero or no elements in there.
17:00
And we can also talk about the cardinality of infinite sets,
17:11
but it is a bit more complicated and we will postpone that until we reach the discussion of infinity towards the end of the lectures.
17:15
So a very nice and easy thing to show is that if I have to settle this joint, remember, the joint sets a disjoined.
17:29
If this year elements, then the cardinality of the union is exactly the sum of the cardinality of the components.
17:39
OK, how do we prove this? Well, this is actually proven by counting.
17:48
Yeah.
17:56
So this is a case where the mathematical verification of the statement is delivered not by a proof I call it here proof because it's a give evidence.
17:57
But it is not constructed using the proof steps. So this is an alternative way of verifying a result.
18:10
And sometimes it's, you know, you're counting and say, well, you have to show that there are seven in there.
18:16
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven Neptun. So this is similar similar construction.
18:21
So I need to argue that the the number on the left is the same as the number on the right.
18:28
Well, I assume that I know the cardinality of A is the number and the cardinal to be.
18:34
Yes. And so I take arbitrary numbers and and then,
18:40
uh and then I can find because by the definition of cardinality and distinct elements in a and there are M distinct elements in B.
18:44
Yeah. So I can find those things. And I know also know because the sets are disjoint that these elements as, as a full list are distinct.
18:53
So none of the BS occurs amongst the age and honestly I a on service.
19:03
OK, so that's an important thing to note.
19:08
Yeah. So the. If I take the union down, I take all those elements together.
19:14
So is this the correct representation of the said? I'm only allowed to put the elements in there which are not already listed.
19:28
And because I know they're all disjointed, all distinct, therefore, I know that these are all different elements.
19:35
So this is the full size of this is the full set of the union now.
19:41
And so I now count these elements. So I go for one to end and end plus one and plus two to employ them.
19:45
So the number of elements in the and all of them. So it is a case worker programme by counting.
19:53
I can use this property to show more and more devolved statements about the cardinality and for example, I can say that if and Viejas Fine I said so,
20:07
I no longer insist that this joint then the size of the union can be expressed as the size of the first subset,
20:23
the first component, and at this size of the second component.
20:30
And then you subtract this the size of the intersection. This is intuitively clear because the intersection is counted twice.
20:35
If you take this size of a headache to size would be.
20:44
So the intersection is a subset of both these sets that you counted twice.
20:49
So therefore you need to subtract it. So intuitively. This is clear.
20:52
But we can also argue to a formula that it is correct.
20:57
Yeah. So I know from the previous part and exercise that you have to in and into know.
21:01
So I've shown the exercise that you have to hand in is that the set A is a distant union of A without B and A the section B.
21:08
Yeah.
21:18
So using that information and the stuff on the previous slide, I can say that the size of A is the size of a B plus the size of the intersection of B.
21:19
Now I can do the same thing for B of course. Yeah. And, and then I get it at the intersection.
21:30
So this is the if you, if you add these two things, they put them in the formula there, then you get this, this formula there.
21:39
I is simple arithmetic. So the size of the intersection is.
21:51
It is clear what I'm sorry. Let me roll back just a little bit. Is it clear that is this this third equation holds?
21:59
Yet. OK, so therefore, I now have that I can express the size of the union.
22:12
I used the first equation that I have now and then I use the results that I have here so I know how I can
22:23
express A and B. So I write A without B as the size of A minus the size of the section I copied it over.
22:31
I write B minus B without A as to the size of B minus sizes and the.
22:41
I do a bit of and I get the formula that I have then. Yeah.
22:47
So again this is, this is not approve using the approved types, but it is approved by, by manipulating equations.
22:51
So it is all also perfectly OK. But if you are reasoning about anything else of course then it becomes a different thing.
23:00
So we've seen that sets can be constructed out of all the sets, you have to be careful, you can't concentrate on anything you like.
23:10
So some of the things that you would like to have assets have to be postulated as we've seen that the union is a case of that.
23:18
The NTSB said that this is not a case. This is what is called the Powerset.
23:26
And Powerset is the collection of all the subset of a set.
23:32
So the powers out of a S.T. is a collection of all the subsets of any.
23:36
And this collection, again, is set. Yeah, it's you can't you can't show this is dead.
23:41
So this has to be assumed. It is one of the things that people need to be that to therefore was added to the actions.
23:47
In the wrong window, so you can take an example, for example, the power set of the set, A and B containing a B,
23:58
so without a subset of that, well, it's the empty set because that's a subset of all sets.
24:07
It is a set containing a subset, the set containing B subset and instead containing both elements and are all subsets.
24:12
The power set of the entity said it has only one subset and it's the set itself.
24:21
So that gives me a set containing the implicit. And so notice that the power sets are is the power that this is set containing sets.
24:27
And so all these things are actually built for the empty set.
24:36
I can attempt to do this for the natural numbers, for example,
24:41
but that is a little bit difficult because it's I can list all the finite sets, for example.
24:45
I can do that effectively, but I cannot list all the infinite sense that it becomes very, very difficult and we will see later in the course.
24:51
And in fact, it is impossible. Yeah, so what I want you to do now, and this is just a bit of puzzling for five minutes or so, find these set.
24:59
So this is the number zero down just to make sure that, you know, so the power set of circumstances, zero reported and then zero and 17 zero.
25:17
And this is so good.
25:29
Try this for five minutes and I'll be back. I'm sorry, but I have a.
25:33
Go ahead. Yes, I saw in your pre previous course you talk about something like the sort of sad
25:41
is not necessarily a sad and is there any connexion between that and Powerset?
25:49
It's because no, because the power said it's not a collection of all sets.
25:56
So the thing that is not a set is the collection of all sense.
26:00
What you do here is you have a thing that is a set and then you take a subset, which is a set as well.
26:03
We have another definition and now you just take all the possible subsets.
26:10
And because you work with something that you know is a set, then the show is the reverse.
26:16
So if you look at the collection of all the sets, you would say, well, that if that is said and done, that is the Powerset of the set of all sets now.
26:21
And so there is a link there. But the what doesn't work is that you cannot define the collection of all the sets to be a set.
26:30
But here we are working with something which is a set already, and then we go in the other direction.
26:39
We take two subsets. OK, I got it.
26:43
Like. And what is the Delta will sign?
26:47
They are this, OK, this fair enough, so this is defined by.
26:59
So it is a decent quality, but I want to stress that it is the quality by definition, not in quality by something else.
27:07
Yeah, so it is it is exactly the same thing. You don't need the job.
27:14
So there is no logical step involved here. So whenever you have a fair, you can replace it immediately by this question, their.
27:19
And I would question, how do you represent the B in, like, handwriting because you can just write a small piece.
27:36
That's fine. That's fine. I find it very difficult to write. I just I just read small and.
27:44
Mm hmm. And.
28:19
Well. OK, so the I hope you didn't find this too difficult, the first one is you have a separate one element.
29:07
So what are the subsets of that one? That's the set itself.
30:14
And it is the MP said. So the Powerset of the set containing zero is empty and self-contained zero that said the second one and has two elements.
30:18
So you can actually go a few lines up and replace A and B respectively by zero and the set containing zero.
30:31
So you get four elements for this set substitute in there and now you have three elements here.
30:40
And the result will be a set that contains eight elements.
30:47
So you have the empty set you have to set containing zero.
30:52
You have to set containing the set containing zero, and you have to set containing this particular thing.
30:57
Now, the 17 zero and 17 zero in words, it's very repetitive it because the brackets are not not pronounced.
31:05
And then the sets with two elements to. So you have to set containing these two together and you have to set containing these two together.
31:14
And so containing the first and third together. And then you have to set containing all three elements.
31:24
No. This exercise is very nice because it shows that you can find a V, so I think that certainly is a good example of the existing element in feed.
31:33
It also occurs in the power set because that's not true here.
31:49
For example, for A and B, that is not true. So it's only true for very peculiar sets that have this set construction site smell.
31:53
OK, there is a link between these sets and number theory for those of you who are familiar with it.
32:03
But I won't go into that here.
32:09
So we've come to a proposition and it says that you can actually count the number of seats in the power sector already in the previous slide,
32:15
had an inkling of this because they have two elements in this power that have four
32:26
elements in this power set and have eight elements in this power set and go for one,
32:31
two and three. So there is this nice link to the powers of two.
32:36
And this is in fact, this holds. And again, this proof is done by counting.
32:41
Yeah. So if I have a finite set with size and then the size of the powers, that is due to the power and.
32:47
So take that said to be the elements you want to end, OK, if you are forming a subset,
32:57
I call it Accio for the moment of the Saturday, we do that by deciding for each element in a if it is in or not.
33:05
Yeah. So for each show, for each element, you do it yes or no choice.
33:15
The so the blue and I don't always turn blue.
33:22
If at the so we have any independent choices for each element of a it is an independent choice to
33:38
decide whether it's an and or does not depend on the choices that are made for the other woman.
33:46
So I can represent an X by a binary number and a binary number is composed of zeros and ones,
33:51
and it has a one a5 five decided that aof so position I in this binary number is one.
33:58
If I've decided that Afie is an X and the position I is zero if the Afie is not an X.
34:05
So I've got a very exact representation of these subsets of a bi binary numbers.
34:16
So how many binary numbers can we build out of any positions?
34:25
Well as you as computer scientist immediately know the answer.
34:31
That's due to the power. And and so there it is.
34:35
This explains that by counting the number of subsets, I'm actually counting the number of binary numbers that I can build out of and positions.
34:41
And that is to Tulipamwe. I'm sorry, but I'm a little bit getting confused, if you ask me a question, I can clear it up for you.
34:52
Yes. So how how do I clarify that all those items are identical?
35:02
Like there's no repeat items because it's a set.
35:10
I mean, I represented at the convention representing who said this, there is no repetition.
35:16
I mean, how do I prove that the power side of Assad does not like repeating them so that I understand
35:21
why you are saying they did this by the fact that all these binary sequences are different?
35:30
I'm not so well, I'm counting I know that every binary sequence uniquely represents a subset and I'm counting the number of
35:37
different binary sequences and there is no confusion there because either one of the zero in his position.
35:45
What if the element of Assad is also a sideshow?
35:53
Well, we like because somehow have like two different two different way to get the same element in the show.
35:57
That's not possible because then it would not be a said. I'm assuming that all the I's are different.
36:07
It's impossible for B.I and B.K. to both point at the same element because then Anicka will be the same element and that's that's impossible to.
36:16
So there is no repetition anywhere, you're right in asking the question, is it possible that when I do my construction, do I recreate the same subset?
36:30
That's in principle that's possible,
36:40
but it is excluded because there is no repetition in the binary sequences and binary sequence is uniquely mapped to a subset.
36:42
So each binary sequence represents a subset and each subset represents is represented by a binary sequence.
36:54
OK, thank you. So I've seen this before, this was already in the slides.
37:03
I've decided to keep it in there. So from this point onwards, the things that we're going to do are going to get very, very involved.
37:09
And writing them down and using the notation with natural language becomes very, very lengthy and almost impossible to read.
37:17
So what I'm doing is I'm introducing a new abbreviation mechanism now,
37:25
so I allow myself to write the statements on the left when I intend to write a statement on the right.
37:31
And so it is an abbreviation. We do not do any formula manipulation.
37:38
You will do that when you where you head logic. They they will focus a bit more on that.
37:44
And I think also reasoning, but we see it just as an appreciation of the statements that we had.
37:48
OK, but I need the abbreviation because otherwise the stuff doesn't fit on the slide anymore.
37:55
Good, yeah, so I hope you're all familiar with this with this notation,
38:02
so we used to double our food if and only if I have not introduced if and only if you had.
38:07
But the ethanol, the F stands for P implies Q and Q in place B.
38:12
Good, and I know that I've always I always called the overset.
38:21
So this makes this very but I might might slip up occasionally in my notation and not write them always.
38:27
But it's the intention is that all the quantifiers. So the.
38:32
And he adds. But by definition.
38:52
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, but none of us can you. Maybe he already got disconnected.
39:39
That's probably what's happened. They're about to go disconnect this stuff with you guys.
39:54
I'm sorry, guys. Yes, one is still recording. So I want to continue with the slides, the bio teacher.
40:14
Anyone understand enough to teach everyone else? Richard?
40:36
Well, that was my name, Dick. Now, because you ask the most questions, I don't think that's true, that's it's mandated.
40:43
Well, Brown, I was too scared to ask questions like Marlon stepped up with.
40:56
The. Yes, I'm back, sorry, my Internet connexion dropped.
41:05
Are you still with me? Yep, yep, yes.
41:24
OK, I'm sorry about that. So did so the next step in this construction.
41:28
So the things that you're allowed to do with sets is to for a collection and for two sets to look at all
41:35
the pairs of all the elements in both sets until I'm first introduced to good use due to my expertise.
41:41
And I can commute to much, please, so we can see your site.
41:50
OK, fair enough. Thank you. Let me do that. Dariya, yeah, Sterk.
41:57
Good.
42:13
So we have an ordered pair of which are very good to pointy brackets and the comma in the middle, and I have two things in there to object and be.
42:14
And it's a sort of pair of and B is not the same pair of BNA.
42:25
So this is not a set notation or anything like that. Yeah, you can compare to list and this is a better comparison.
42:30
The I, I can define in Cartesian product of two sets, it's called the Cartesian after Nethercott,
42:39
a famous mathematician who first introduced this notation, and I write the quotation product with the time symbol.
42:50
That's why it's called the product. And I will explain why the Times symbol is used there.
42:58
So this is the collection of all the parts that you can form out of and B,
43:04
so of A on the left element of it on the left and the elements beyond right.
43:07
Yeah.
43:14
And this just so I'm not stating that these are selected from art form sat there and that's because I can't I just said it's not been created yet.
43:14
So this is defined to be a set like union.
43:25
And the powers that we have, this abbreviated notation for a binary product of a word itself, A squared.
43:30
And the Saudis, we have a new notion of said, as I've said the in the beginning, we need to define for each set inequality.
43:40
Sometimes the quality is natural. In this particular case, it is inherited.
43:50
Yeah. So the equality on the condition product is defined as that the first elements are the same and the second elements are the same.
43:55
Yeah. There you can define different equality's on on Peronists.
44:05
We will see some later. But the normal one on the Cartesian properties define taxes.
44:10
So it's a pairwise equality. Yeah. Point towards equality.
44:15
Some examples you have to the coordinate system. So the real the pairs of real sets.
44:21
An example, for example, have a marriage registration system in the.
44:27
It's a binary relation,
44:35
even though it would be possible for a person to be married to more than one now because each marriage still concerns only to two partners.
44:37
So another thing you can check very quickly and easily is that the is the motivation for this time similar to the product?
44:55
We said the commonality of the product space is the product of the cardinality of the components.
45:06
So this is why the Times symbol occurs in the construction and because it's inherited there.
45:15
So you do this again by counting. In this particular case, it's even easier than the one we had before.
45:22
You have elements in A and elements in B, and you're right down a matrix.
45:29
You're right, a table where the A's are listed downwards and the B are listed horizontally and you write down
45:35
all the combinations between elements in A and B because you're doing this systematically.
45:43
You have covered all.
45:49
Yeah, there's no repetition because you always go for the change the oil change to be the end to be certain or repetition and sort of set instead.
45:50
B has no repetition, so there is no repetition in this table.
45:59
I know you do a simple counting and it's immediately clear that this table has end times and entries.
46:02
Yeah. So for finite sets, that's very easy.
46:11
The the cardinality of tourism product is the product of the garden and it is you can do the same thing for.
46:15
For many sets, we can lift the binary product into an ordinary product.
46:26
This is a generalisation of using brackets. So this although it's not not exactly the same,
46:33
but you can do the energy product of a novel such as the set of all the tuples now that are composed out of the elements of the component sets.
46:40
And again, the general product of A is related to power.
46:54
And so, for example, yeah, if you take the three dimensional real space, that's ar3.
46:58
So it has all the that's the collection of all the triples of elements of our.
47:09
Good in half an hour. I'm on my clock, I think it can just about do the next one.
47:18
So can we now show that the product property that we have for binary relations gets extended to the one for any real?
47:27
And the answer is yes. So the size of the product of an entry product, because it's already cardinality of the Cartesian product over any elements,
47:38
is the product of the Cartesian, of the cardinality of each of the individual sets.
47:53
Yeah, you can prove this by something that's called induction at this point.
47:59
In my previous versions of the course, I would have discussed as it has been moved to the second term, so to speak.
48:05
So I can't do the proof here. But again, once once you've done the induction principle, you can come back and check.
48:13
It is true. And so it's a very easy property to show, but we need to prove that we haven't discussed it now.
48:20
And so. Well, what I wanted to say before is that this is a generalisation of the bracket notation,
48:29
but as a matter of fact, you can argue that these things are all different.
48:36
So if I take the the triples or I take the pairs of with a pair on the left of take a pair of things that appear on the right now,
48:39
then these are written down differently. And you need to argue that they are, as a matter of fact, the same set.
48:50
Well they are not the same sets, but they are very, very similar.
48:55
So we will look at the correspondence between these two sets later in the course.
48:59
So it is not the case that if there are brackets in this product notation, you could take the product out, the brackets out.
49:07
It's not like multiplication of numbers at all.
49:13
You get different sets. So if the brackets are there, the brackets are important.
49:17
But we can show that there is a strong relation between these sense.
49:22
So they're not equal, but they are related. OK, well, we know what time is it?
49:27
It is ten to 12. It is the perfect time to stop. Are there any questions?
49:34
I have a question, so I don't think I still understand the equality on elements part of the Cartesian and binary product line.
49:41
But again, I will go through a.
49:52
So this one here, you mean? Yes. Yeah.
49:57
So you have pairs, so and B can be completely different sets.
50:01
You have, for example, you have a natural numbers in A.
50:05
And you have rules. And B now. So then you can say that the number two appear a AB,
50:10
that's a natural number and the real and the CDs a natural number and the rule when are dispensed equal.
50:17
Well if a natural numbers are equal then it's a real C.
50:23
OK, so this a is this because your national numbers are down on this equality, convince anybody else?
50:29
When we write the the pens, should we use, like, those pointy brackets or like the normal, like to put brackets, know the pointy brackets?
50:43
OK, so I thought I by the way, I define things, I also introduce notation now, so you need to stick to that notation.
50:53
Allowed in exams to use the prove by saying we're going to draw this and you can see this is just how many elements are in it or if it is applicable.
51:06
Yes, I've done it so that there's nothing wrong with that as an approach, which I have to write.
51:16
I have to use it in the right or the right moment. So it depends on what you're trying to show.
51:21
I was wondering whether you could clarify when it's applicable to use the abbreviations for the like,
51:30
and it's so deep, so what I have here, so in my particular case, it's the stuff on the slides, this stuff in green.
51:36
Now, for example, here in this in this notation here, so I have four or I.
51:46
So this is this is this I should have written this in words.
51:54
So you can you can replace a statement, sort of introduces a statement by a formula, so that's just fine as long as there's a coherent expression.
51:59
Yeah. So don't use an implication,
52:10
but something on the left and the right and don't use the end symbol without something on the left and the right, et cetera, et cetera.
52:12
Right. So you can use it when defining statements but not well actually making proofs about those statements.
52:19
Yeah. So do so if you write for example,
52:25
I know that beholds and therefore Q holds the wood and in that sentence cannot be replaced by the end symbol because that then becomes nonsense.
52:29
OK. OK. So it is not an abbreviation for natural language.
52:38
It is a deviation for statements. It's the Cartesian product of two sets of set, yes, by definition, but then I was just thinking,
52:43
wouldn't there be cases if they're repeating elements in A and B, then you would have repeating like.
52:58
What's it like, would it be possible to have repeating elements in Cartesian product?
53:10
No, because every element in a gas linked to every not a single element in a gas linked to every element, and B, if, for example,
53:16
three occurs in A and three occurs and B, then the pair three three occurs in the product, but it is there only once.
53:27
So it's not we do not ask that A and B are distant, distinct.
53:36
Now, I can do the calculation problem for David itself and still OK.
53:42
So remember that you have to so you're not adding a extreme poverty, adding the bag containing a into the containers, put it.
53:47
Right. OK. OK, that's it, you need to go to the next lecture.
53:57
I stopped recording now.
