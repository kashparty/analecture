Title: Induction -- Motivation and Challenges
Category: 1 - Induction over Numbers
Lecturer: Sophia Drossopoulou
Date: 17/01/2021
Welcome. We will not stop the discussion of the use of induction to reason about all sorts of things.
0:03
We will be listening about the programmes, but we will be also reasoning about numbers about any recursively defined structure.
0:09
And the last part is what that allows us to use induction to written about all sorts of other things that are of importance in computer science.
0:22
For instance, algorithms, protocols, programming, languages, type systems, all these things that are defined inductively.
0:32
That means start with something small and apply rules to create something bigger.
0:44
And this inductive thinking is reflected also in the proofs.
0:51
Anyway, we'll start with two motivated examples, which I will discuss with you again later in the course.
0:59
But I want to set the scene and you can have fun thinking about them.
1:07
The first one, which I called the Game of Frogs, was proposed to me by Bart Vishniac, who was a student in our department a couple of years ago.
1:12
And this example is what he was asked at the interview for a bank, and he did answer it correctly and he did get the position.
1:21
So pay attention. We have got the plank of N metres length and enemies are not sure.
1:31
No. One, two, three and so on. And we start with n frogs.
1:38
Each of one each of those is at a different position on the plank.
1:43
And the frogs either move from left to right or from right to left on the plank.
1:48
And each of them has got a certain speed and all the speeds are different from each other.
1:55
When the two frogs collide and actually it can be more than two frogs, it could be.
2:00
Three and two frogs. Anyway, when they collide, then the one that has got the highest speed continues his journey and the rest flip the direction.
2:08
And when a frog reaches the end of the plank, then they fall off the plank and they turn into a prince.
2:20
And the question is, will all the frogs eventually fall off the plank and all turn into princes?
2:28
Or is there some configuration where the kind the frogs so oscillate with each
2:38
other and there will always there will always be from the left of the blank?
2:43
So here I have got my plank, the the black line,
2:56
and I have got a green frock and another green frog and lots of more green frogs, and they move in different directions.
3:00
And let's say that this frog here moves at a very high speed, whereas this one moves at the smallest speed and the this one more moves at that speed.
3:11
So we have got three frogs which are going to collide at some point when they do collide.
3:29
Then the frog with a higher speed is going to continue his journey.
3:37
So this one has got the highest speed. And he will continue his journey.
3:42
This one with Flip and that this one would flip.
3:50
And I have indicated that in blue, how they vote, the speed that and the direction that they will have after they have collided.
3:57
So we have understood what how the game works and the question is,
4:14
can you think of some initial configuration in which some frogs will be left on the plan and will be going left and right in perpetuity?
4:18
The next question I will be calling the beetle and the cactus and it goes as follows.
4:34
We have got a beetle and the cactus the cactus can eat leaves off the cactus.
4:42
But when it does so, the cactus grows back. And the question is whether the B.T. will eventually consume the cactus.
4:48
Whether the Beattie can eat the cactus in some way so that it will never consume meat or whether there exists a cactus that can never be consumed.
4:58
But here are the details. The cactus corresponds to a tree.
5:09
And when the beetle eats one of the leaves of the tree, then that leaf is removed from the tree.
5:13
Now, if that leaf is a child of the roots, then the leaf gets removed and nothing happens.
5:20
But if it is a child of the roof root, then the cactus will grow back as follows.
5:26
We call Stubbe the subtree, which starts at the parent of the leaf that has been eaten.
5:33
And we create the two copies of the stop under the grandfather of the leaf that was eaten.
5:43
I will demonstrate this again in a drawing. So we have got to hear the cactus.
5:52
This. Blob here represents the road to end, it has.
6:04
It is a tree. So it has got two children, let's say, or let's give it three children.
6:09
And this child, again, has got two children.
6:18
This child has got three children. Let's throw some more children.
6:23
So this is a cactus, and to eat is nothing else than the trees, as we have loved about them already in earlier courses.
6:43
And now what happens when a beauty comes here is a Bakiev.
6:53
Or that is what it looks like in my driveway. And the video can come and eat any of the leaves.
7:03
The leaves are the auto parts of the tree.
7:11
So. These are the leaf's.
7:15
These are the only things that the BTC could go and eat.
7:20
Let's say that the victim eight. This one here. If it's this one, then because of this silly if it is a child of the route, then nothing happens.
7:32
But if the leaf is not the child of the route, then the cactus will grow back.
7:44
For example, if it were to re eat this leaf, then what happens is that we will go to we will make a copy of the tree under the parent.
7:53
I'm going to draw that in green so we will make a copy of what I have highlighted here in blue.
8:11
We will make two copies of that and we will put it under the grand final.
8:19
So we will make one copy of this one. And another copy of this one.
8:23
And place it under the ground. Byrant. And let's think of one more example.
8:31
Let's say that the beetle aid that leaf.
8:39
Then we would need to make again foppish.
8:47
Of the three up to the grandparents, so we will make a copy of what remained and put it under the grandparent.
8:55
And as you see in this case, I have removed one leaf and I have added two new leaves and parents.
9:10
And here I have removed one leaf and I have added two new leaves.
9:22
So the question is, does the cactus always grow back?
9:27
Is it possible for the for the BTC to ever consume the complete cactus?
9:34
If it is possible to do that?
9:43
Is it possible for the BTC to make sure that to eat it in a strategic manner so that that the cactus is guarantees to survive?
9:45
The end of the beetle is guaranteed to have some food in perpetuity.
9:55
So this is the motivations that I would like you to keep at the back of your mind and in the next lecture where we start with
10:05
induction and eventually we will see how we will use induction in order to talk to the problems that I have just discussed with you.
10:15
I'm looking forward to any suggestions you might have about how to do those, how to tackle those examples now.
10:24
And please go to the next video.
10:32
To start the discussion of induction or numbers. Thank you.
