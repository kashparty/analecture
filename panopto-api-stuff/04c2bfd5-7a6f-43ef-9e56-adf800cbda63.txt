In this topic, we look at how to map an extended and civil partnership model into a relational schema.
0:01
Taking generalisations first. We're in for disappointment in that using just primary keys and foreign keys.
0:10
There's no direct way of representing just jointness in a relational database.
0:17
There are rather complicated techniques you can use using triggers,
0:22
but they're not part of what I've presented so far in the present presentation of the issue of the relational model.
0:26
And therefore, I'm not able to represent the just jointness. So in a generic generalisation hierarchy, I simply represent none.
0:33
Email user and email user as a subset entities,
0:42
i.e. I create a table for each of the entities and inherit the key of the superset entity salary number down into both none.
0:46
Email user and to email user and make a foreign key from the salary number of non email user to person and from email user up to person.
0:55
For weak entities, though, we can get a complete representation. And it's based on the idea of taking the key from the Entity Table that is the parent
1:07
or the controlling entity of the weak entity and putting it into the weak entity.
1:20
So if I have a person and I introduced a swipe card two years a week and see a person,
1:26
the swipe card is represented as normal as a table called swipe card with issue and dates and then an issue forming part of the key.
1:32
But because it's a weak entity, i.e. I have this one one associated with an underline for the swipe card to person relationship.
1:42
I includes salary number into swipe card as part of its key, along with a association from swipe card.
1:52
Salary number to phone calls from study number two person salary number.
2:01
This means the swipe card cannot exist without the salary number existing in person.
2:06
This person's deleted the swipe card has to delete it and hence gets the concept of a weak entity being represented.
2:12
Notice if I get rid of the underlying on the one one association from swipe card to person,
2:20
it ceases to be a weak entity and the change in the scheme is simply that the key of swipe card no longer includes salary number.
2:28
And of course,
2:38
their full salary number could change and the salary they swipe cards could be changed from belonging from one person to another person.
2:38
By updating your salary number. Anyway, relationships take a simple extension of the rules for binary relationships.
2:46
So if we have a many, many table, I treat a table to represent the many, many relationships,
2:58
plus a foreign key from that new table to two different entities it connects.
3:06
By contrast, if either one many relationship, then it will map to a set of columns being put onto the table,
3:12
representing the entity where the one one association is found,
3:20
together with a series of foreign keys pointing at the different tables related like to buy the relationship.
3:25
Let's take an example. I'm going to map a many, many relationship.
3:33
And let's suppose I have person manager and department as the entities that can be connected
3:38
and to make it a little bit more complicated as to suppose manager is a subset of person.
3:43
Then if I had in a works in many, many relationship between manager, person and department,
3:50
I need to create a new table for works in which combines together the keys of the free tables it connects.
3:57
And of course, the salary number appears in both person and manager. I need to rename them to make them distinct.
4:05
So let's just suppose I top the convention is put on the table name in front of the attribute to disambiguate it.
4:11
So I have person salary number and manager salary number.
4:18
I presentare and then I generate foreign keys for each of the three connexions I have with the different entities.
4:21
I one going to person, one going to manager and one going to department.
4:30
Sometimes it's natural to add tributes on to relationships instead of onto the entities.
4:40
And we follow the same mapping rules in terms of putting them on the objects, which the at the table, which is representing the relationship.
4:48
So if I have a many, many relationship, such as works in between person department and I have a start date and end date associated with it,
4:58
the start date and end date are added onto the works in Table,
5:06
which is representing the many, many relationship between person department warehouse supervisor, one many relationship between person and department.
5:11
The one one means that work seems going to be represented as a natural fit of person and
5:21
therefore the start date and end date will also be added on to the person relation.
5:27
An interesting question arises of what to do when I have actual values on a
5:36
relationship which has a zero one count another to on one end of the association.
5:42
Most popular answer was AAA, but the correct answer is in fact be noticed here that the works in relation is going to have a start date and end date.
5:57
If a person has a involvement in it, but otherwise there's no start date or end date,
6:11
and therefore it would be quite incorrect to put it on to the person entity, as you find in Option C.
6:18
However, we do not want to make it the same as a many, many relationship option.
6:25
A is, in fact, the mapping for many, many relationship between person and parliament.
6:30
The Option B because it only has as its key, the salary number means that in effect the works and can exist once and once only for each person.
6:37
And then, if it is in existence, it must be associated with a department and therefore it becomes a optional objective person.
6:50
And if it exists, then we must have a start date and may have an end date.
7:00
So be fully captures the semantics of the optional relationship, which has a attribute added to it.
7:05
The nested relationships, we simply need to think of using the normal mapping rules, but treating the relationship being connected as an entity.
7:18
So let's suppose I've already constructed an air model where I have a works in relationship between person and department and also a project entity.
7:27
So out of that, down to three tables representing entities.
7:37
Plus in this case, because I have a many, many association for works and a fourth table representing works.
7:42
And then if I aren't in a member relationship between work and project,
7:49
I'll simply treat works as an entity and hence I will create a new table for member,
7:55
which connects together the project with the works in relation and nurtures.
8:01
Here, the salary,
8:07
number and name have been taken as the key of works in and put into member and peacoat has been taken as the key of project and put into member,
8:08
and the free attributes together form the key of member and then the salary number and D together are
8:20
compounds form key points at the work scene and P code by itself is a foreign key points in that project.
8:27
If I change the Association of Works in some project to be a one one association, then again,
8:35
I use the same mapping rules as normal and that means that I at the P code and key into work and plus a set in an extra
8:44
foreign key from works into a project and the attributes of the member role is a. then as an attribute of the works in Table.
8:55
Each multi valued attribute should be mapped down to a separate table.
9:13
So Smith acted in multi value, which refers to the person entity, the phone and car they will cause to separate additional tables to be handed,
9:19
which in the table contained both the attribute value and the key of the entity, which she has a multi valued attribute of.
9:30
And it's the combination of the value and the key of the entity which form the key of this new table.
9:39
So in effect, each person phone is identified by the combination of the salary of the person that we have a phone number for, plus the phone number.
9:48
Notice there's no difference in the representation between a plus card and constraint i one to encode loyalty,
9:58
and I still can't motivate you to actually be a tie not to win.
10:07
And that's another weakness of the relational model. There's no way of forcing the one.
10:11
Many characteristics of the plus constraint. OK,
10:18
you have enough information now to take the worksheet you should have already completed
10:25
about constructing a extended air model and mapping it down into a relational schema.
