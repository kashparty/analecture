This court, so which version of the one with Pruett's would you like me to do happy to show a if only if C,
0:00
B, if only A, D or B implies A or B, some some support,
0:08
though,
0:13
just to be not if it's gonna be two dimensional on any particular preference for which one will look at any of these cases you were surprised by.
0:13
Perhaps I'd be the best one to look into. Can we do A if only if C could I say so.
0:22
A a shot to follow along.
0:29
One that is most popular to people. So. Proving efficiency is obviously going to break this down.
0:33
So A implies C and C implies a sense.
0:45
Let's start off then with. So let's do a implied C.
0:52
So if we don't do this carefully and kind of style that we use for sort of proofs, given this course we have are given.
1:00
So that's gonna be a. Which is going to be for all X.
1:08
There is some Y such that if the X and Y are friends.
1:12
Then. Happy X.
1:20
So what this means is that everybody has a friend, they are happy.
1:25
Well,
1:31
I would read that book to say what we are trying to show is what is really important in this course to make it very clear what you're trying to prove.
1:31
In some sense.
1:41
If you're trying to prove the wrong thing, then it's kind of more about what the proof does off that point to be really important for our cause.
1:42
You're very clear that what you're trying to prove might become more clear as we go
1:49
through the later parts of the course that in some sense we often give quite a few marks,
1:51
an exam, whatever, for setting up the proof correctly,
1:57
because a lot what we do in court is going to be just about getting the trying to prove the correct thing.
2:00
That makes sense. But the other thing, of course. So this version here is slightly different.
2:05
So here we're saying that for all X no, no, that the the inner for all here for a Y is going to bind quite tightly with just the friend x y.
2:13
So this is for everything. Everything is a has a friend.
2:23
We didn't be excessive. Yes, if always you are the friend of those those lies, then you're happy in some sense.
2:31
And what it comes down to really is kind of how we push a quantifiers around over over bracketing and third case and stuff.
2:40
An important thing will be the number that falsity would always imply truth.
2:47
So in some sense, that be quite a few cases where this one isn't true. But that's going to be okay because the implication will hold anyway.
2:51
But let's looking to the direction here. So the proof then. But this case would be so first of all,
2:58
we look at the gold and we see that we're trying to do something that has an outside for all outside anything else,
3:05
which means you're gonna take X one arbitrary because we always do.
3:11
Pretty much always do when we have strategies like this. And then we can assume.
3:15
A property, a cool one. We're assuming that this part here, the left hand side holds because it got out.
3:21
Now it's broken down inside before all we're left with an indication. So then we say for all, why, friend?
3:29
X one Y. That's our assumption. Now we need to show that.
3:38
Happy. X one memory so far, so this is gonna be fine.
3:48
So I sort of set up peripherally. So then we need to basically work out.
3:55
We can do well if we look at a map here.
4:00
This is a nice property that says, well, for any X, so I can substitute in my X one here.
4:04
And then I can also know that there exists some Y.
4:10
Yeah. So for. For some choice.
4:14
Of why? Then we can have a new property, which is that just using a.
4:21
Friend X1. That's cool. That sounds interesting.
4:30
Why one would say. Important thing here, this is not an all too twisted bill that could exist.
4:34
Let's be completely arbitrary. It's just we have some particular concrete. Why one?
4:41
So for some of it, some some choice here, I can deduce one that's from.
4:46
I'll give them. I'm just basically using the quantifiers in the way to be compensated through.
4:53
That's a subsidy. Anybody going to pay X one of X? I'm going I'm picking.
4:58
There's some choice of why they're. Then that means.
5:02
You can then also say using property one up here, there.
5:10
That's a for all why? So I can plug whatever I wanted to that I'm allowed to let the white one kind of carefully chosen one.
5:15
That is the existence for a line to live.
5:20
Once it holds the accidental, it's a white. So here I can say. Friend X1, why one?
5:25
That's from one. That makes sense.
5:32
And then. At that point, I can say, well, line four allows me to say, I've got friend X one.
5:38
Why one? And. From lines to 30.
5:48
So I've got this property here now that tells me that if I have a friend X one, y one, then X one is happy.
5:56
And I've just shown on line 30. So I've got a friend X one, Y Y one.
6:04
So basically I kind of I can use that to get all the applications I can break on indication like gives me the happy X one.
6:09
That's from line to line three of my proof.
6:17
Thus. We've shown you don't have to use linking words.
6:26
I find it helps to talk to many people to the more readable. Oh, why?
6:33
Friend Swan, why Claus?
6:40
Happy thanks. One. So especially I guess it's just kind of showing how we can get back up to up to here a bit higher.
6:45
So the proof because that why was. It work.
6:57
And therefore, then importantly, since X one was arbitrary.
7:03
Then. Stifler's says uses including what to be a with this.
7:12
This line here, like four did all the work. I'm struck a little bit more detail.
7:20
I'm done. Done. And here's why. From. What's your level five as well?
7:24
That all make sense. And then we could do the other direction, improve in a fairly similar way.
7:31
The proof in the direction people are looking for. Can you use case being? Absolutely.
7:38
I think that would be smart. Right. But I don't think I'm looking at actress in Japan.
7:42
So you. Yes, sir.
7:50
On the other. Proof proving.
7:54
But see implies a. Probably requires.
8:02
Cases. I'll leave that for you to look at in your own time, if that makes sense.
8:09
Everyone happy with that? Hopefully you can see how that works.
8:16
It's not too complicated to prove,
8:20
but I can break it down in the way that I would go about doing it with the stylised proofs that we use in this course.
8:21
So what song we up to real time that mitotic. That's a good time to basically have one more question we can break out for a few
8:28
minutes into into rooms and try to see if I can serve in the room this time.
8:33
Another people are here not joining on the fly anymore. And then what we'll do is we'll have a look, a question, three happy dragons proof.
8:37
So you give me one second. So I've got the slides for that over here.
8:44
So this is the formalisms, someone on their side, she as well. Oh, happy time.
8:52
Just before we start going, breaking out. Give me a chance to yourself.
8:56
I would like to show you quickly how this looks in natural deduction, and that might help motivate why we don't necessarily match this course.
9:00
So I'm not going to rush out because I don't have forever to do that sort of session.
9:09
But this is kind of on the outside. We are given's. We have got to show it's super easy.
9:15
And the action that's Dutcher Proof will look like here's one of my earlier
9:19
this year and it's hard to shrink the text to have it fit on the page at all.
9:23
So that's quite a lot, right. You can see here that there some 25 steps to this proof.
9:28
Overall, nearly five of those are given. So I guess a 20 steps to the proof.
9:36
You should be able to do it with our style as proof in a bounce.
9:40
I think 10 to 15 steps just because we can make bigger steps.
9:46
So go have a go at it. 70 groups maybe we had to go to feel free to discuss the solutions you've got in the break room.
9:51
So I'll try and play around them as I can and then we'll come back.
9:55
And I guess the important thing will be that we're going to be trying to use equivalences within the proof so we don't have to break it down.
10:00
Kind of piecemeal state in particular, the middle here.
10:07
We've got very, very small entities, things like Green Dragon, Fly Dragon, these things as well.
10:10
So go have a go at it for 50 minutes or discuss your answers and we'll come back, according to you.
10:16
And I will go through the style as proof in the last 10 minutes of the story.
10:20
That's OK. Feel free of questions as well. We got the catalogue Q&A up, experimenting with it today.
10:25
So please have a look at it if you want. I was going to stop the recording here and I'll record again later on when we go.
10:30
I'm going through the answer for this one for you guys.
10:36
