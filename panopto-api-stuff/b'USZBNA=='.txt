Title: Q&A4
Category: COMP40017 - Linear Algebra (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
You have to make sure that it's not just that we would actually look at all these things.
0:15
I wish I was like, Oh my gosh.
0:42
On the question of what we're just for question in the sense that you such as, I think we are not attaching so much.
1:00
I love this type business. What's up?
1:44
I would just like to say I have seen a lot of difference in state run elections.
1:49
So these are some of the things I was hoping I want to talk about.
2:23
I have to say, that's okay.
2:50
Great. People on Zoom and my audible on this good earth.
2:56
Hi, everyone. We'll continue with where we stopped.
3:11
Last thing. OK, even before that, I hope your meet your daughters had been scheduled for this week,
3:16
either already happened yesterday or the day before that or they are about to happen today or tomorrow.
3:25
Or basically, you are that close to me. Deterrence could happen this week.
3:31
Is there any group where your daughter has not contacted you as yet?
3:36
Which group is this? Group number two.
3:42
OK. OK, I look into that.
3:50
So let me write that down. Anyone in the Zoom chat?
3:55
Are there any groups which don't know when your movie tutorial is this week?
3:59
Sorry, we got you got them.
4:08
I think it's all right. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I had to remind everyone.
4:12
Group two has been contacted. Good. Yes. Right.
4:18
So that's great. Good.
4:23
All right. Other than that, any more any questions from whatever we have covered so far, it's all.
4:29
Once you get the hang of it, it's not that difficult. An elimination method is not that.
4:38
Difficult to get ahead at you, but yeah, it's just a matter of practise, I guess.
4:45
So any questions related to that? OK, then I think I'll start with one question.
4:50
Yeah, good, good. Can we prove that invoices don't exist using determinants or is that not allowed?
4:59
Yeah. I mean, you will be at some stage you will prove that when the determinant is zero,
5:08
then the inverse doesn't exist that will come at ETS at some stage at this point, can we use it at this point?
5:14
No, you you can, actually. If you can see.
5:23
So you start with the assumption that the determinant is zero.
5:31
And then somehow in your an elimination method, you show that there will exist a rule which has all zero entries, then that could count as a proof.
5:35
But I think I'll have to think about it in more detail. But yeah. It is probably possible, but I don't know the details.
5:48
It's not fresh in my mind. Yeah. OK, any more questions?
5:59
So the thing is that I'm not yet defined, determined, and we have not yet defined what the dominant is.
6:07
And the approach that I'm going to use in these lectures is to give you an intuition behind these concepts,
6:13
like matrix multiplication, determining what is really happening. So determinant is something that you will see is a way of measuring how a
6:21
hollow matrix when it is treated as a function changes the area of the space.
6:29
So we'll look into that. We'll look into that when we come to determinants.
6:34
But now let's start with again, very simple concepts, vectors and matrices.
6:40
So last time, I was probably trying to explain something in haste, in a hurry.
6:46
And that's why I didn't do it well. So let's start with vectors.
6:53
And. Vectors are easy to understand, they're simply list of numbers and other list of numbers.
6:59
So when someone says a vector at X, we arrange it in as a column.
7:08
Generally, you also then you'll also your words like roll vectors and column vectors,
7:16
but when we say vectors, it always by default, therefore is to a column vector.
7:20
OK, so a column vector, which looks like x1 x2.
7:25
And. Where there are in numbers. It's an ordered list because when you change or reshuffle these numbers, the victor changes.
7:33
A geometric interpretation is that it's a point and an end dimensional Euclidean space.
7:42
And one way to think about is in terms of standard basis is that it is x one distance in one direction.
7:50
In this direction. Plus X to distance.
8:02
Along the second axis or second direction or whatever you want to call it.
8:10
Zero one zero zero. So on until ex and distance in the end it axis along the Annett axis.
8:15
And I'm emphasising on this interpretation, because this will help you understand metrics and how metrics operate on vectors later on.
8:38
So this particular interpretation of a vector would prove to be useful.
8:49
When we are dealing with matrices, so this is how we should understand a vector.
8:57
Now let's look at matrices. Now, there are two ways to think about The Matrix.
9:03
One would be let's consider a matrix. It's a collection of vectors you can think of.
9:15
So what? Let me fill the matrix was a one one. A one two.
9:28
A one and. Eight, two one eight two two.
9:35
Dot Dot Dot a two and. And one.
9:41
M2 dot, dot dot image.
9:48
OK, so one way to think about The Matrix is that it's a collection of column vectors.
9:53
This is a column vector. This is another column vector and so on.
9:59
So that's one way to think about a matrix, the second way to think about the Matrix is that it's a kind of function.
10:06
So let me write it down. So our first interpretation would be.
10:14
It is a. Collection of.
10:23
The US. And our second interpretation is.
10:33
It is a function, is a kind of function.
10:39
OK.
10:47
And if I were to denote dysfunction, I probably use the notation f subscript a to denote this function that this matrix represents and this matrix,
10:48
if this function, if it would be a function from it, will take an end dimensional vector as an input.
11:03
So. It's a function from the end dimensional vector space to an m dimensional space.
11:10
It takes a vector of size N and then outputs are vector of size m.
11:23
Right. Which is what we have seen from a system of linear equations.
11:30
This is this is where this notion of function comes in, right?
11:37
Now, let's look at specific, specific examples.
11:45
What would this matrix do to the standard basis vectors?
11:52
So let's next, let me take. What would if A.
11:58
Say one zero zero zero all the way down.
12:07
What will this be? This will simply be eight times. One zero zero all the way down.
12:13
It is nothing but the first column of that matrix, right?
12:22
So this will be. One one, eight two one.
12:30
Dot dot dot a m one. Is that correct?
12:37
So the matrix.
12:45
It's the standard basis act as an input and generates an output, which is its own entities, which are the Andes as one of the columns in that matrix.
12:47
OK. Similarly, if I were to take this function.
12:58
If A. Of C zero zero.
13:07
One. 0S all the way down.
13:14
Where one is in the in the third. It's in the toilet.
13:18
This would simply be eight times the same thing. Which would mean it is the third column in that matrix.
13:28
So A. One three.
13:44
A two, three. A M3.
13:49
So we know what dysfunction does to standard basis.
13:55
Now let us try and understand what this function does to any given victim.
13:59
OK, so let's do that. Oops!
14:05
So this function f e to any given Victor.
14:14
X1 X2. X in.
14:22
And dysfunction to any given Victor and I go back to our victor interpretation,
14:32
what one one of the interpretations of a cousin as a linear combination of standard basis.
14:38
I have not defined what a linear combination is,
14:43
but basically that first interpretation when you go x one distance on one X is extra distance along another axis.
14:45
So if you use that interpretation, then this function is just a function.
14:54
Or it's one of one zero zero zero zero.
15:02
Plus, it's two of. Zero one zero zero zero.
15:08
Oops! Plus X and.
15:20
Zero zero. One at the end. And when you do this, you'll get this is X1 Times, if a of.
15:31
One zero zero of. This standard basis, plus it's two times f a of the second standard basis.
15:49
And so on. Accent times.
16:06
For the FAA of. Last standard basis.
16:12
Right. And what are these functions? What is the output? This is just the collapse of that matrix.
16:22
Which is what matrix vector multiplication is defined as.
16:30
Right. This is how a matrix multiply two, a vector is defined as this if you see it as a function.
16:37
This is what it means. It is X1 Times the first column of a which would be I'm denoting that first column of E as A1.
16:46
OK. A1 represents first column of. Plus, it's two times the second column of the.
16:56
Plus. All dot, dot, dot, x and dimes.
17:05
The third column ofthe. And it not deterred.
17:11
Oops! And once you start looking at matrices like this now, matrix vector multiplication is make sense.
17:27
OK? In high school,
17:44
you have seen that formula maybe go across a row and then along the column and then multiply each element by element and then add them together.
17:46
But you wrote, learn that formula. But this is the beauty.
17:56
Why we have that formula comes from the functional interpretation of a matrix.
17:59
OK, so now let's look at matrix times made the multiplying two matrices.
18:06
So let let us have two matrices. One is a which we have already seen a one one.
18:15
To a one and. And one.
18:26
And. This is an m by and matrix, it has M rows and columns.
18:33
Let's consider another Matrix B. And this one.
18:42
Last question. Sorry. Yeah, go ahead. US should, it shouldn't, if any of the victors return another victim.
18:50
So I understand how the result was obtained. But yeah, it returned another victor, which is a column vector within that matrix.
18:57
So I think this notation is confusing you. This thing, right?
19:10
These A-1, A-2, any and what these are, the column vectors of it, so I think I should be right.
19:17
It can be seen as a one, a two.
19:31
And. There any air is a column vector.
19:38
Is that OK? Yeah, thank you. Yeah.
19:50
Billy, we were. I'd be so let be one.
20:00
Oops! Be one one all the way to be one.
20:06
Let's let's take. B one K.
20:17
But that could be. And one could be in key.
20:25
This is an end by gay matrix. OK.
20:35
These are gay column vectors. Each Richter of size in.
20:40
So one way to think of matrix multiplication. Is.
20:48
When I multiply a. With Be.
20:58
You can think of it. As. The function f a plane on operating on each column vector in B.
21:07
That is one way to think about it, so I can say that if a.
21:22
So let me call this column because. This is my be one.
21:32
And this column is my be. And.
21:41
Bill Gates, so all right, so one way to think about a matrix multiplication is that the matrix on the left,
21:49
that air matrix acts as a function on each column of The Matrix B.
21:58
The one. Plus, if a on B to.
22:09
If A on B. OK. OK.
22:21
Now this when you elaborate. We'll give you the formula that we do use for matrix multiplication, which is.
22:27
Summation of. Just.
22:39
OK. James J.
22:48
K. I'm missing the kids this game that they're different, so let me use another.
22:56
And. OK.
23:05
Oops! I ranging from.
23:13
I ranging from one to I is corresponding to a one two m.
23:25
And L, ranging from one to. The.
23:33
And this is the entry. Did I miss something?
23:46
Oh, OK, OK. Simply, this is Jake was from one to.
23:54
And this is the I inlet and the.
24:11
All the metrics that you get and the output, basically the formula is fine, basically, you know,
24:18
you have studied in high school how to multiply to make as you go along a row and then go along a column,
24:24
do that dot product and what you get at the end would be the idiot and three of the final matrix, right?
24:31
So that same formula,
24:38
but I emphasise on the interpretation of that formula why that formula makes sense and from a function applying the function on the left,
24:39
on the column that goes on in the matrix, on the right, right.
24:49
So. Next, let's look at some properties of these matrices.
24:54
Of some of matrix multiplication, one is that. It's not committed to.
25:01
What I mean by what we mean by that is that a times B is not the same as B times A.
25:15
If we, first of all, you need to ensure that that is possible or not, if the dimensions match or not.
25:22
This is not equal to. B times A.
25:29
OK. And. One way to think about this is that.
25:36
You had you have if a. Times if B of the.
25:45
Matrix A multiplied by Matrix B is the same as Function B, operating on a vector and then functioning operating on that output of that vector, so.
25:57
I think you can see it for yourself. A times B times a vector X.
26:11
Is the same as. If B.
26:24
Of X. And then you take the function f a.
26:40
Of the outlook of every object, so it in some sense eight times B, its composition of functions.
26:49
All right. And similarly, when you look at B Times A, the claims of Actor X, all the dimensions should match, obviously you can think of this as.
26:57
If a composition of functions where you apply to a function first and then you apply the FBI function.
27:18
Obviously, these two won't be equal. All right.
27:33
This is something we know from functions. But of course, when you're when you're trying to solve it,
27:40
you can see for yourself that matrix multiplication can will result in two different matrices.
27:45
Eight times B will result in a different matrix. B times will result in a different matrix of different dimensions.
27:52
Sometimes, yeah. So. So it's not Comitato.
27:59
What else are what are other properties of matrices?
28:05
Let's see how associated with this, so this is the property of.
28:18
You need to if you are if you have three matrices, A, B and C, there are three matrices.
28:28
Eight times be. Times, see.
28:39
Would be the same as eight times. B times, C.
28:44
Right. So. Again, you can either prove this using the formula and proving that the output, the left hand side,
28:50
the matrix that you get on the left hand side would be the same as the Matrix that you get on the right hand side, but that is more laborious.
29:01
One in one interpretation, which we are using, which is our functions, will make sense.
29:09
This. The.
29:15
E times, B times C on the left. In terms of composition of functions means.
29:22
If A. If B.
29:34
If see, if I if I also say any Vector X.
29:43
This is obviously equal to this because we know when and from functions,
29:55
we already know that composition of functions is associative, hence matrix multiplication is also table.
30:04
OK. But of course, when you are brewing such statements to be more rigorous,
30:12
you need to adopt the more tedious process of showing each element in the matrices
30:20
that you get on the left hand side and write and say they are identical. All right, so what is distributed between?
30:26
Basically, just adding of matrices is simple, it's just.
30:41
You go component wise, ED. You do that of.
30:48
And if you have. A plus b times see this.
30:55
This will be the same as E times C plus b time C.
31:02
But not the same as three times A.
31:09
Plus, C times B, OK, the order, whether you are multiplying it from the left or from the right, make matters and why it matters,
31:13
because that order is you, in which order is the function being composed of the underlying functions being composed.
31:25
OK, so this doesn't happen, but this is true.
31:34
You can see it for yourself. All right.
31:39
So we have covered Distributive City and the identity matrix, which we have seen so far.
31:47
You have seen earlier that anything multiplied to an identity matrix matrix remains the same.
31:54
So E! Times identity matrix, of course, the dimensions should match.
32:03
So it is an MBA and is. M Times and Matrix.
32:12
OK, then the identity matrix would be a square matrix of size and names in.
32:21
This would be the same as a which would be the same as identity.
32:32
And things and. OK.
32:41
And again, the function, the interpretation in terms of the function identity represents that function,
32:49
which does not change the importance it is the identity function, so f of X equals X.
32:54
For all legs. OK.
33:05
This is that matrix. The identity matrix is represented in this function.
33:10
All right. I could perhaps just say, OK.
33:18
So far, so good, we have understood me to see matrices as functions.
33:25
OK, that is a question. I didn't see the jack. Shouldn't it be f of B1 B2?
33:31
Not the summation. Which one are you referring to? This was a while ago, so.
33:38
There's a question in the chat. Which was.
33:52
Yes, you are correct. So. When I did it, Ms.
34:07
B, yes, it should be a matrix, not a plus sign. You're right. I think I made a mistake that I.
34:11
Now, I can't find it. OK, so OK, I made a small error in when I do, when I did a.
34:25
Games be. This is equal to.
34:36
The function f e applied on. The column Vector B won the first column of Vector B.
34:43
And then. A.
34:56
On the second column of Kobe. And so on.
35:01
On the. And that column or get column.
35:13
OK. Good. Yeah.
35:20
So you should get a matrix at the end. OK, so let's now look at what is called the transpose of a matrix.
35:26
Again, a very simple concept. Where you just flip the matrix along the diagonal.
35:38
And this will prove to be useful when we.
35:45
For example, sometimes when you have a rogue actor and you want to turn it into a column vector, you just take a transpose,
35:53
especially when you're coding and when you're programming, say in deep learning, you will be using a lot of matrices, then the transpose helps a lot.
36:01
But yeah. So. It is simply one, two, three four, five six, I'll use an example to explain or transpose.
36:14
Then a transpose is simply I flip along the along the diagonal, so it will be one two three four five six.
36:30
OK. So we we all know what transposes.
36:43
Again, these are all concepts which you have already studied in high school, most of you.
36:49
But I am repeating it for those who are looking are seeing this for the first time now.
36:54
Let's look at. OK, what would be the transpose of?
37:04
Eight times, B, the whole transport now is a matrix B The Matrix when you multiply the two.
37:19
You get another matrix and you take the transpose of that, can we write this as?
37:29
It transports must be transports. Anyone?
37:38
Is this true or false? It's false.
37:48
It's not. Yeah, so tell me the reason. An example would look.
37:55
Who was it, first of all, I had? I think that sheep, the sheep were not much, OK?
38:03
That's also good. So let's assume the sheep also matches, then what can be the reason?
38:14
OK, first let me let's take that example where the sheep doesn't match.
38:23
So let's say this is this is a two by three and this is a three by four matrix.
38:29
OK, so what will the aid transpose be? It transports will become three by two matrix and a b transpose will become four by three matrix.
38:43
Now. As we have seen earlier, if if a transpose were to be a function which takes.
39:02
And input vector, which is two dimensional and then produce an output vector, which is three dimensional.
39:15
By the way, you're we see that the input, the column vectors and B transpose are not two dimensional.
39:22
So, so one obvious reason that this is not true is that the dimensions will not match.
39:29
But suppose they met, supposing that these are all squared matrices. Is it still true?
39:34
Is it still false? So let's take example.
39:40
Still, no. Let's say all these matrices were two by two matrices.
39:46
So this will also be a two by two matrix we transpose will also be a two by two matrix.
39:59
So the matrix multiplication is also two by two matrix. What what you get as the matrix.
40:05
The output is also two by two matrix. It is transported to Dubai to St, then why is this not true in this situation?
40:11
Again, if you think in terms of a function, the. The way I the top right.
40:22
Good. Yeah, that's the perfect way. So your input, if you think of this as a function, is a function.
40:38
F off a and it applies to the column vector b one and then.
40:47
And then the same function applies to the column better we do. Oops!
40:59
Yeah. OK, and then you take the transpose of this, so this is what left insiders, on the other hand, the right hand side.
41:04
Your input is no longer the same column, it is now the role victims.
41:20
OK. So this would be some other function.
41:26
Gee, all. Be transpose one.
41:33
And G of B transposed to. OK.
41:41
I didn't do it properly. Gee, all be transposed to.
41:48
And then all you need to know. All you need to understand is that your input has changed.
42:05
Earlier, you had the columns of B. Now you have the rules of B.
42:11
These are columns of B. These are rules of the.
42:17
Also, the function has changed. This was a different function, and genes are different function.
42:30
If it was a different function and go as it is now a different function because of because it's flipped.
42:37
So yeah, once you think in terms of function, all these properties will make sense.
42:43
Otherwise you have to go step by step to prove each and every statement.
42:47
OK. So and then finally.
42:53
Multiplication by a scalar. Yeah, so scalar multiplication is the only thing, which is.
43:03
Which is commutative in the sense when you multiply a scalar to a matrix.
43:16
OK. Lambda times in.
43:25
This is the same as eight times. No, this is the only instance where commutative property holds OK.
43:30
When lambda is a scalar, it's just one or a vector of size one.
43:40
OK. That's it, actually. We now know what matrices are and some properties of matrices.
43:48
And the next time we look at this basis and the motion of some spaces and and the notion of basis vectors,
44:00
one basis vectors we have already seen, which are the standard basis.
44:09
Standard bases. So let's take the example of a three dimensional space.
44:15
Let's say we are looking at a three dimensional space. Easy to visualise.
44:25
So the standard basis vectors were. One zero zero, this was what we referred to the unit vector in the x axis.
44:30
Then zero one zero, the unit vector along y axis and then zero zero one, the unit vector along Z-axis and every other point.
44:41
In this three dimensional vector space could be reached using these vectors and some linear combination of these vectors.
44:56
So if I want to reach the point.
45:04
Oops! If I want to reach any random point.
45:12
X y z.
45:26
I can go there by walking x distance along one axis, then walking y distance along this other axis and then walking z distance along the third axis.
45:29
These this is what we mean by bases close vectors which form the basis of the entire vector space so that you can use them.
45:38
You can just multiply them with some scalar and then take the linear combination of the three to reach any given point.
45:49
Every point in the space should be covered using these vectors. But I could also have.
45:57
Different bases, but apps which look slightly different, which are not so standard, but have something like I could have won one zero.
46:06
Then zero one one.

And then. Perhaps minus one zero zero.
46:25
OK. These are three different vectors. But again, you can reach any point using these three vectors in this space.
46:35
Now this can also be another basis. And alternative basis, perhaps.
46:43
For the art, for our three dimensional Euclidean space.
46:55
OK, so next time we look at business, we look at linear combination.
47:01
Then we look at how many pieces are needed to cover. Any any dimensional vector space.
47:06
We also look at the relationship between number of bases required and.
47:13
The rank of a matrix, these are gone. This is something I have not yet defined the rank of a matrix, but we will reach there in the next.
47:24
But I've tried to just upload a few videos in the meantime on these topics.
47:34
So, yeah, any questions? OK, good.
47:39
I have a list of problems on this basis, but I'll do that after I cover that topic.
47:48
OK, so we can indicate your and I'll see you next time.
47:55
Thank you. Bye bye. Thanks. Well.
