Title: Comparing Proof Styles
Category: 0 - Proof styles
Lecturer: Mark Wheelhouse
Date: 19/01/2021
Hi there. Welcome back again. So throughout the elections today, we've been looking at different types of troops.
0:02
So far, we could see the three main types looked at free proops kind of writing in English, waving a hand with a bit of room to be detrimental to it.
0:08
We've looked at the natural seduction style, what you should be familiar with from the first course in logical,
0:17
first off logical reasoning called Superagency Student.
0:23
And then earlier, I kind of introduced you to the idea of a stylised proof, which is slightly different way of doing things.
0:26
Using all the same rules and deduction allowed us to make bigger steps and make use of equivalences, for example, in our footsteps.
0:32
So I encourage you for a second maybe to pull the video and write down what you think and the pros and cons, all of the different styles of truth.
0:40
And then I'm going to flip on a second and show you when that matched up with kind
0:49
of my interpretation to what I think the pros and cons of these types of reform. I've had it tough to do that now.
0:52
So here is kind of my summary of what I think of these things.
1:00
But the good and the bad to the free form proofs, you can butman quite quickly.
1:04
You have an intuition trying to write down.
1:08
And I think the nice thing about free form truth is it does tend to expose the intuition about why you think that this property is true.
1:10
Of course, they can be quite error prone. I said before about waving your hands around.
1:18
Sometimes it can seem a bit like you make it up as you go along and it can be hard to be convincing sometimes with a free form proof.
1:22
So that's the issue that we not a deduction. One of the best things you have,
1:29
the total confidence in the proof that you can stick it into Panopto or your lean wheel favourites to kind of cheque in new things and be sure that,
1:34
yes, you are followed every rule kriv every step. It is 100 percent correct.
1:42
That's time. That's quite a nice promise. Hopefully you saw in the previous video we get quite long and allowed.
1:46
Can be quite challenging at times to get it right.
1:52
I think it's often the case that you have to write the rough ones and then go back and write it up neatly.
1:54
I don't think it's acerbity that you get the intuition out of various proofs because they reduced everything
2:00
basically to the base atoms of all the information that you understand and they build it up again.
2:07
Scrap to see if you can get to the kind of the goal of the proof.
2:13
I think the intuition can often be lost within that process. So what you have an issue that I think Stylez Chris last dealt with in my previous video.
2:17
So the structure, the object is made quite explicit, just like it would be in that production,
2:29
although I think it follows more informed reading sense.
2:33
Not doesn't you often have to think about when you make a step that goes back with rather forwards.
2:36
Certainly my approach never stops being very mechanical way of doing things that you can make some errors,
2:40
but it tends to be hopefully very few long into following the rules correctly.
2:47
So I think, yes, the downside is you can still make mistakes and can still make an convincing step in your proof,
2:50
but also be good because it means you don't believe some step. You can basically take a Alema and go and expand that stuff.
2:56
More detail to make sure it's correct, which I had detected a tactic would you agree to?
3:02
You get a lot of things. So that's kind of my opinions on how to compare these different types.
3:07
So I think when we think about going forward,
3:13
what we want to use within our kind of proof styles as we get more experience mathematics than it's worth thinking about really what we're aiming for.
3:15
Without that support him, we can't make a good choice. We don't know what would satisfy.
3:24
So first versus those things very important. Want to prove only but statements if I can prove things that aren't true.
3:30
That's not a very good, logical system because let me prove complete garbage and then no one has any confidence in anything that I do.
3:36
That's a pretty important to have. It's also important that it's possible for us to be able to cheque the proof over or someone else.
3:43
Also to cheque to provide a mix, too. I agree with that proof. When he writes it.
3:52
It's also quite important for good proof that you can come back to several days
3:58
or weeks or months or years later and still have the ability to read it easily.
4:02
I can understand that. Yes, you agree with that proof? It's definitely correct. Proof.
4:08
And more importantly, it's good that other people can also do that process because it proved you right.
4:12
You will probably remember very well and come back to it. Maybe not if it's been a long time, but higher chance that you remember what you were doing.
4:18
Somebody else coming completely at this cold. They haven't seen the proof as you're writing it, perhaps.
4:25
And it can be quite tricky to take a hold firm to understand how that the author that you've got that.
4:29
So you allow other people to get something important. And again, a nice thing.
4:35
Ideally, it's not a necessity, perhaps.
4:39
I think is an important thing to give you is to give you some idea of intuitions behind the arguments so that you can become more convinced,
4:41
we believe more. This is a decrypts or it gives you some white intuition about how to solve similar problems.
4:48
So with those in mind, let's take a look at our kind of three types of people seen so far.
4:54
So the table in earlier. The idea of free form is that you can get kind of get lost and get wronged fairly easily.
5:00
I've seen quite a lot of people try and things like oddments to kind of jump big
5:11
steps of proof by turning the page sometimes where it's just not convincing.
5:15
And the big step in the middle of missing, we haven't spotted that again with no proof about symptoms.
5:18
The first things are going to come in, some people in. Laughs That was a good argument, but actually it was missing an entire step.
5:24
We can even make the link between the super and the person that was actually invalid
5:28
when possible to do the proof until we add that extra condition in free form proofs.
5:32
I tend to find them very, very hard to read, particularly if you're reading somebody else's free form,
5:38
because words that made sense to them could be very hard to replicate what they were trying to think when you read it back to Spectrum.
5:43
However, they do do a good job.
5:49
I would say of harder intuitions behind because you really get an intuition why the author believes the situation got to.
5:52
That is correct. What property holds without a deduction, you get that most confidence about what is kind of valid.
5:58
If it did, you could stick it through a machine. You can definitely kind of verify that this thing is entirely correct.
6:09
That's definitely not followed. And that's a good thing to have easy readability.
6:13
I mean, the jury may be out date on that. I find that Russian troops can be used to be and can be very hard to beat.
6:19
Really depends on the proof. The bigger they get, the harder they get to read.
6:25
Even the group with only about 15 steps gets quite long and quite, quite tricky to handle the boxes as a grapefruit thing.
6:29
Once we get quite tricky to read, it becomes a completely blank without seeing it in the first place.
6:36
And that's kind of lost. But when you see the proof is usually given to you as a whole thing done, you don't tend to see the evolution Heigel.
6:41
I think that production really struggles by not having the evolution of how things go.
6:46
You don't just read them top to bottom. You work bottom up as well.
6:51
Sometimes that can be tough on people. That's a good thing.
6:55
And again, they can plug it straight into the kind of prove is all the tools you might use as well.
6:59
So you can get a confidence in them. But the intuitions. Absolutely.
7:04
These are lost almost entirely. Uptimes reduce everything to base elements and put it up again.
7:08
While in doing that, we lose the real high level linking between two concepts that you might otherwise have.
7:14
Come back then to our stylised prints at the end. So here pretty bad.
7:20
Most of the time that would be true. Obviously, we can still go wrong with my justifications aren't strong enough.
7:25
Perhaps we trick ourselves. So there is a slight risk that we've introduced by phones.
7:31
I did. However, the hope is that they are easier to read both by the author and by others.
7:35
That's wrong because they're being quite descriptive in how they're written out.
7:41
The links on the right hand side, justifications for every step that say this is one follows.
7:46
This is what I'm plugging to get to be.
7:51
What I think that keeps the readability quite high because quite a lot of things were without having all the clutter of boxes you
7:52
get from tax reduction and the intuitions that can be lost depending on on how we rewrite things or they can be quite clear.
7:58
That really comes down to the skill of the author in writing down a nice clear of proof.
8:08
So hopefully you can see from this why we're going to choose to focus on this stylised view for doing things,
8:14
not module, we think is one of the best compromise of the other cases and isn't as long winded as doing lots of stuff.
8:21
So there'll be a few the. I'd be happy with not doing, but it doesn't feel quite sad.
8:27
My hope is that by the end of the module, I would hope we could get more of you to being quite happy with doing things in this US proof
8:32
approach that perhaps you might take forward in later years as you kind of come more confident.
8:39
I want to write things aren't quite so piecemeal, kind of mechanical, as much tension, proof.
8:43
So there are a few rules, then, for how we're going to approach writing out a stylised proof to do it in a most consistent way.
8:51
So we have clarity. So the first thing, especially for these steps.
9:00
So first of all, we went right up, all the things that you've been given.
9:04
So you write to them and give them a name. We typically call the numbers. One, two, three, four, five.
9:08
You're going down the page. And those you've given us the information that you kind of know or properties that you know that you can work with.
9:12
So, yeah, our supreme sample is things like knowing Superman, the people, the super villains, the rich or the is going to top the first ticket.
9:18
Then we went down the bottom of the page.
9:27
What we want to try and show, like multiple things that like one thing, I tend to label these with great catalogue, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta,
9:30
just to keep them distinct from my given's and to reduce the chance to accidentally end up
9:39
using something I'm proving somewhere in my proof is my justification site from Alpha.
9:43
From Beta. That's probably a I'm using something I haven't proven yet.
9:48
It's a good way of keeping these two given's things to show entirely separate head.
9:51
Then comes kind of the invented that we think about. How are we going to do the proofs to set them plan up?
9:57
What kind of of attack? I don't know. Buy start in the next slide and try to think about what's the structure of the thing you're trying to show.
10:03
Well, given that we've got that help is getting there and trying to use that kind of sketch out what our approach is going to be,
10:11
you're doing this proof and you can do that quite informing, forming enough before we stop and write up the real possibility.
10:17
Fine. Then once you've done that and you go further proof, write down top to bottom,
10:22
make sure that you justify every single step start as proof that doesn't have justifications.
10:27
On the right hand side is a bit like a tax deduction. Proof missing kind of reconcile ticks and box numbers.
10:32
It doesn't really mean it's done. It's not necessarily complete.
10:38
So you reinspect where you put the patent in otherwise just making steps and fingers crossed that you got it right.
10:43
So I think paladares applications are really, really improved availability of a future both yourself and also for the reader,
10:48
as well as become more confident with writing out these proofs.
10:54
Then you'll be able to vary, decides the steps you take to make make bigger steps as you go.
10:59
I will start off as you pretty tall long term to make small steps, do very simple things at a time.
11:03
And as you get more confident, you can have bigger steps or start just done to make very big steps to improve lives.
11:09
Second, better if you want to. And that's really where the power of the star comes in, allows you to adjust how the proofs look.
11:14
I present the proof is based on your own experience as you become more familiar with doing logic proofs,
11:21
with doing scoopers throughout this course and beautifuls as well.
11:27
So the trick is part of this is always about kind of thinking of what's the plan going
11:33
to be and how am I going to justify the steps that I'm taking within this group?
11:38
So. Let's think that. If we're trying to prove something such that this is kind of the going goal focussed like we were trying to prove some property,
11:45
then we can use the structure of that property. We're trying to prove to direct how we're going to go about laying out the structure.
11:58
Oh, it's important that group prove even that doesn't that's why you can things like what's the weakest connective of the go yet?
12:05
Is it a fraud that just nuts? And these are just rules that you should be very familiar with from tax deduction.
12:12
Use these. Always try to pick out kind of method of attack on this problem.
12:19
So if you're trying to prove something, it doesn't add it, then you're going to need to prove both left hand side and the bottom side.
12:23
You're trying to prove something. It's got a disjunction or in it. They only have to prove one or the other.
12:29
And you must try to think about which one you actually meant to try to prove in practise, making it easy.
12:34
What was that? But that's what's to be done. If you've got an implication, then you assume the left hand side.
12:37
I mean, show the violent side. They're going to alternate quite a lot.
12:44
The proof that I showed you in the last few days.
12:48
If you've got a negation, then you can assume the thing is to go to Q and try and get to a false conviction.
12:50
This one is not wrong. If you've got four all that we've pinnacle,
12:58
we've taken arbitrary elements of the X and then tried to sell the property to whole polls for that, to that arbitrary choice of.
13:02
If we got an existence, we had to find that there's some constant that we can use to search property.
13:12
We don't care what how we choose to quantify neighbour.
13:19
And otherwise, we can always try a context and let's assume that not Piers, to see if that gives us false.
13:22
And then if that doesn't mean that the assumption was invalid and actually that reasonable
13:29
uptick must hold those kind of a go to tactics for how we're going to go about doing things,
13:33
because it's kind of planning out the entire line.
13:38
And then conversely, when you've got some properties, either, you know, given the things that you've already established,
13:41
working down to the proof, you can then break apart in various ways to help you make progress towards your overall goal of their goal.
13:46
And again, this is just like natural deduction rules for. Q And ah, would we have both?
13:54
Q And separately from one to health and separately from the bigger recession, if we have Q or all that, actually we can't know for sure where.
14:00
We also have to recognise this one side of him. Q One was hearing, are we going through those things if we have something where.
14:09
Q implies R and Q Then we can then basically use the mind that we play, we've already established that side of the.
14:20
That us kind of break the implication and get left over with just the obvious.
14:27
But I now know that because I have the information left on supplication, I can deduce the right side.
14:30
That's what you think you have to do. And we often use that when applying certain rules about giving.
14:36
Similar to that is when you've got like a rule or in this case we found already,
14:42
if BP knows the holes rule things, that I can substitute the X for anything I want one time.
14:47
And often they have different rules, tend to be rule X, do X implies R, X, and that's kind be using the previous rule as well.
14:54
But how we can get rid of the rules if something exists and that was true for some constants, they can do it through careful.
15:01
Get to make sure that we don't start seeming to fill in using this since going down.
15:09
It can be handy. If you got false then we can deduce whatever was not because it couldn't get there.
15:15
And the proof and that's why the of contention approach can be useful and how we go about proving allegations as well from the previous stuff.
15:21
And if you've got something where we have not Q is true,
15:29
then we'll know if we have ever try and assume cute when we get the false hopes of breaking up cases.
15:35
If you got a case equal, often kill them quite quickly by saying, let's assume this off the case.
15:40
But I know from some of the property that I've already been given that this site can't exist.
15:44
That just kind of goes away. The other two things that are very powerful that we do in Starlight's groups, if they can be sublevels,
15:48
will quite often break down big coquet problems into problems with lots of letters that we can do the members to do steps for us and the main proof.
15:56
And then going through the numbers separately, the next kind of logic, a bit more modular in how we approach it.
16:04
So that you have big. And in particular, which allows you some logical occurrences, Mexican steps forward.
16:09
And that can be incredibly powerful in avoiding breaking down insertion into lots of little pieces to the outcome, which is much deduction style.
16:15
We can often kind of rewrite them in place by spotting things about how that phrase or using other gibbons' to rewrite the rules in place.
16:23
That's not before it happened for us going forward. So hopefully that gives you a bit of idea about how to work with this.
16:31
The tutorial this Thursday is a focus on helping you to get used to writing style troops and the end goal.
16:38
Let's talk. You should be able to tackle this happy Dugan's problem.
16:44
I'm pretty certain you will seeing a logic course in the first term and you will solve this with natural deduction or certainly that.
16:49
But I would like you to get the end. We'd be able to do this problem with the style life style.
16:57
We'll go through this at the end of the session on Thursday.
17:04
In the story sheet, you'll find this problem will be formalised into the following set of organs.
17:07
I'll leave you there for now.
17:13
I encourage you, please have a good for Thursday to count at least colon on Thursday to like session and try during that session.
17:14
We'll go through this at the end of that session.
17:20
