Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
So that you could be talking about that right now.
0:06
Oh, no, no, I mean, I think a lot of work to do on.
0:51
I don't think so.
1:46
There were six six six nine thousand six hundred eighty six o'clock in the morning.
2:13
Well, I think I say, let's not forget about that, right?
3:32
That's right. I was going sit.
4:06
So it's no together with no excuses.
4:31
That's right. That was a couple of people on Zoom.
4:52
Am I audible as far as? What we have.
5:01
Yes, we can hear, yes. Yes. Okay, great. All right.
5:10
OK, let me turn on the screen in the lecture theatre.
5:18
What happened to this one? The site stopped working.
5:24
The left side of the street supporting the.
5:32
Anyway, it doesn't matter as, OK, all.
5:41
Right. So we have for the first two weeks, we have been covering pretty much basics, and once these basic concepts like what The Matrix is,
5:49
what a system of linear equations are, what what, what does it mean to solve a system of these basic concepts out of the way?
6:04
Now we get into some of the juicy bits of me that I just got.
6:13
So make the spaces. You cover these three topics today before that.
6:18
Are there any questions from the past two weeks? I hope not.
6:25
It's not that complicated. I don't see anything in the chat, either.
6:30
So, all right, so let's move on to this. So make this basis.
6:37
So who can tell me what does it make this space like?
6:46
OK, maybe you can start with an example. We want an example of a space that you know.
6:50
As any anything, any simple example. Apps odd.
6:59
So let me just. Change in my skin.
7:06
You often say. The space of N Dimensional, we call this the end dimensional vector space, we often call it the space.
7:16
What makes it a weakness? Just a sec. All right.
7:27
If I if I can just say it, this is just a set of all.
7:31
X1 Xin, such that excite.
7:36
Is a real number for all I. From what one do any?
7:46
So this is just to say what makes it a this piece. So when we call this civic space, we are referring to.
7:57
The SEC itself, along with the operate, the binary operation of Vector addition,
8:05
this this corresponding to the vector addition, Betty, and we have defined what we mean by adding two elements of the SEC.
8:13
And a scalar multiplication, I'm denoting it with this sign not to be confused with enough product or the outer product.
8:25
This is the scalar multiplication and this notion of additive identity, which is often it's it's the zero vector.
8:33
So this quadruple of a set,
8:47
along with an additional bridge operator along with a scalar multiplication operation and the zero vector comprises as a vector space.
8:51
This when we when we say ordained is of the space, we refer to all this as a wake up call.
9:04
So. Let's look at the abstract to read the definition of a vector space.
9:17
The jump again to the slide.
9:26
Now, I do not think this is in your lecture notes,
9:34
but it's still and it's still important to understand where does the definition, what do we mean by Wreckfest based?
9:37
So as I said, you need to have. So, OK, there are many versions of this piece.
9:47
There is a complex space,
9:57
but in this module we are referring to only the real vector space where the scalar multiplication happens with a real number.
9:59
OK. So by vector space to be to a set which has this special element called zero.
10:08
It's actually called additive identity. And in the sense that when you add it to any other vector within the SEC, it doesn't change.
10:17
It doesn't produce anything new. And it comes with three operations additions inverse and scalar multiplication.
10:26
Now this inverse is a concept which we can replace with a scalar multiplication by minus one.
10:38
So that is kind of redundant. But if you are getting really abstract, we can define something which.
10:46
When you get there, we will need it in books, but in in most examples that we will look into.
10:56
We don't really need to invest because scale up multiplication, but minus one does are does the job.
11:04
So are. So we have these three.
11:10
Operations addition in multiplication, and these operations need to satisfy the following actions,
11:15
which we know this, which we have covered, which is like in the first page of your election or so.
11:24
Right now. Yes. Audin seems to be a most of.
11:34
An intuitive vector space, which we understand intuitively, we don't really need to remember the definition and stuff like that.
11:41
But let's look at some unusual vector spaces, or maybe just one to two to demonstrate that it's not that.
11:48
Straightforward to define of space. So I'm just moving everything away.
12:00
Now I'm defining a new set. OK.
12:07
Which is the sake of only positivity, real numbers. All right, I'm creating a new space.
12:13
So I look at only the set of positive real numbers.
12:22
OK. Along with. The addition operation of.
12:28
The addiction operation is what I actually use as the usual my.
12:38
OK. This is my addition operation, this when we multiply two numbers in the three six.
12:46
I'm calling that tonight as my additional operation for this vector space that I'm creating.
12:59
OK, so this is my addition. And my multiplication is the exception in any vector, any element to all of the sick and raise it.
13:07
To the scalar number that you use. So I just use the word exponent.
13:25
OK. I'm the A. Identity in this state is my is the number one.
13:37
OK. This is a vector space. If you look at the definition of a vector space.
13:49
The addition operation given to Elements X and Y and X in that said, X one can form a sum and can define a sum, which is also an element of X so Oyun.
13:59
If I were to denote this as my plus and I'm I'll call it the new plus and I'll call it called the exponent as my new scalar multiplication.
14:16
OK. And this is the new additive identity.
14:30
That's. Oh, OK, yeah. All right.
14:38
This the multiplication of two numbers is what I am calling it as the Ed Ed. Operation, and I'm I'm using the notation plus new.
14:48
It's the new definition of ED.
14:59
Similarly, might be multiplied, same with new a new notation just to denote what we mean by the what I be referring to the multiplication,
15:05
the scalar multiplication in the second. And one is, are it?
15:13
Yes, because a false.
15:20
All right. So, Steve Multiplicative, I guess, people, not necessarily megacities.
15:26
Yeah, so as far as the spaces are concerned, we are only interested in addition of the vectors.
15:36
And a scaling of those vectors. We are not interested in multiplication or vectors, which is why there is no multiplication provided.
15:47
OK. OK. So, yeah, so this is how I have defined a new set along with new operations and a new additive identifier.
15:58
And you can see that this is closed. The addition operation is closed.
16:10
This the safest glows under the additional operation. Right? You take any, any do numbers extend why?
16:16
Any two positive real numbers? So X.
16:27
Why, which is the same as expense by the usual multiplication is also a positive number.
16:34
Right? So it's closed under this edition operation.
16:43
And. You take again.
16:49
X multiplied. OK, I need a scalar.
16:57
So. Let London be the scalar. Any of you lumbered with switch skills, the victor, so lambda times.
17:01
X would simply be X to the pod of Lambda.
17:21
That is what I mean by the exponential operation. And this also is a positive real number.
17:27
And the addictive identity, you can see that one.
17:44
When you add one. Do any work, any way, any element of the sick.
17:51
So one. Plus, New Times, OnePlus X, which is the same as.
17:59
Which is the same as. One times X, this is the oil multiplication.
18:12
This will be X, it doesn't change, so it is acting like they are to do identity and one.
18:19
Times. New. X would be the same as extra the bad one, which is the same as X, so it's acting like the the identity, the zero vector.
18:27
So make the this can be done look something like this.
18:45
You mean the scalar could be a complex number as well,
18:50
but we are only interested in ordering as out of the space with the usual addition of two vectors.
18:54
The usual addition operation and the usual scalar multiplication operation.
19:02
So we go back to. So we go back to our Oops!
19:07
The original vector space that we are so used to and we will be using in this module, often we would be.
19:19
Odd to the in, along with the usual addition extradition operation,
19:30
where you add the element element to isolation of the actors and the usual scalar multiplication operation and the usual zero vector, which is.
19:37
And dimensional vector with all entries means you. Right, coming back to this week, the space.
19:49
Now we define what is called a vector subspace.
20:00
Now, Rick, there's space of this, this is a vector space, so what what do we mean by a vector subspace vector subspace?
20:07
If I call this, I just refer to this as odd, and it's it's understood that the operations and the additive identity is there.
20:20
OK, we need not keep writing it again and again. So vector subspace?
20:31
Of. Either the bottom is defined as any sick.
20:39
Any subsidy, any said X, which is a subset of in.
20:49
Such that. X, along with the usual addition operation, along with the usual scalar multiplication operation and the zero vector.
21:00
Is. A vector space in itself is closed.
21:13
It's a vector space, and it's it. A subsegments Islamic A based on.
21:21
So the definition seems easy in the in the lecture notes, you see a slightly different definition, but it basically means the sea.
21:35
If you look closely, it's just ensuring that the these operations are clear.
21:44
The SEC X is close under these operations of addition, vector addition and scalar multiplication.
21:49
OK, let's try and solve your problems.
21:57
Which of the following six are sub spaces of the three dimensional space located in Euclid space that we know?
22:15
Right. So how do we get these, how do we check if the sex A, B, C and D are?
22:29
Vector sub space is a subspecies of ivory. Yeah, that's.
22:40
Yes, that would be one. It needs to be a subset.
22:50
Yes. The 088, which is the idea doing, I guess.
22:53
Yeah, if you take any two elements in that suit and you add them that the outcome should also be an element in the same sex.
23:08
It's unburied issue. That said, is close and there it is. All right.
23:18
And what about multiplication de la multiplication?
23:23
So, of course, it also needs to because exactly they're out there, you only need to test for things.
23:31
So oops. Oops!
23:42
So you need to check. One back at the front, right?
23:51
You need to test only for things. One.
24:08
Is that the SEC X or OK, going back to the question, will we look at the first SEC?
24:13
OK? You need to check if a. He is subspace.
24:22
All three, this is the question.
24:35
Yeah. She. So this is what we are trying to figure out.
24:41
So first thing you need to check is. If a is a subset of our.
24:50
Second, you need to check if the additive identity, which will always occur because we are not looking at those unusual spaces is an element in it.
24:59
Three, you need to check if any two elements X and Y in a.
25:15
Implies X plus y in a.
25:26
Any directors and no phone need to check if it's in a lambda is a really no.
25:32
Then.
25:45
Lambda Times X, which is just scaling back Vector X, should probably use road signs just to just to remind you what is a there and what is a scalar.
25:47
OK. Lambda is not a victim. Other than that, everything else is on it.
26:00
So this also belongs to it.
26:04
So these are the four things you need to take. All right.
26:09
So going back to the question. Is this a subset?
26:12
Yes. Quite obviously, we are looking at the sect.
26:19
It is a subset of arbitrary because it always has three elements which are and each element is a real number.
26:28
Is this is the zero vector in there?
26:33
Anyone. Yes. Yes, because if you choose land that will be zero and new to be zero, you get the zero vector right.
26:38
Is it closed under addition? Now, this will require us a little bit of work.
26:47
So let me go back. It is lambda lambda plus two and lambda minus.
26:55
All right. So I beg to ask, does a.
27:07
One second, lambda lambda plus new to so I'll take lambda one lambda, one plus new one cube.
27:19
Oh, by the way, we we should always stick to our notation of the presenting vector as column vectors.
27:29
So OK, we have lambda one lambda one plus mu one cube.
27:37
One minus new one. This is a random vector.
27:47
In the set, a. Plus.
27:55
Number two, number two plus new to cube number two, minus new, do you?
28:01
The addition? Would simply be number one plus number two.
28:13
Lambda one plus lambda two. Plus new one to plus mule to CU and Lambda one.
28:20
Plus, number two. Minus one cube, plus two cute right now, is this in a.
28:35
Yes. What would be then what would the new lander be, Lander, OnePlus lander?
28:54
What would the new movie like to pass?
29:01
So you take the cube root of this solution, and then that would be new for this, right?
29:09
Yeah. So easy to see that this is also closed under this closed under ED.
29:16
So this is yes. Is this true now, what about scalar multiplication?
29:26
If I have. Scaler, let me use a new symbol.
29:45
Sigma is a scalar. And my victor is number one.
29:54
No, just no. Lambda plus new to lambda, minus new Que.
30:01
This is a so, Sigmar Times Lambda Lambda plus I have a question and lambda minus for you.
30:12
Yes. You know, the previous example, what would you do in the case that like me, kids and me, one kid in me to keep the both negative?
30:22
How would you find the keeper of that? I. I didn't write it formally, but I'll explain once again.
30:31
So let me go back to that example, right?
30:42
So. Did you do you understand that we have obtained this, Victor, by adding two random vectors?
30:50
OK, now if I choose.
31:02
Lambda to be number one plus number two.
31:09
And choose. Oops!
31:16
New to be in the. Two groups of new one two plus new 2Q.
31:25
Then with this choice, we can we can be sure that this victor that we have obtained belongs to a.
31:38
This choice of London mule ensures that this vector that we obtain from the vector addition of two random vectors.
31:53
Also belongs to it because it satisfies their definition of a.
32:02
Is it clear now? Yeah. OK. So you wrote it, scalar multiplication.
32:11
So we we have a random real number and arbitrary real number.
32:21
Sigma and then arbitrary arbitrary vector lambda plus no lambda lined up missing YouTube lambda minus YouTube.
32:27
Now all what we need to show is whether Sigma thinks this belongs to a or not.
32:35
This is equal. Two Sigma Times Lambda a Sigma Times Lambda plus Sigma Mutual.
32:49
And stigma times lambda minus sigma muc, you.
33:04
Now, in this case, I either choose. I should have probably used a different location, but anyway.
33:11
I will choose. The new lander to be at times, lambda.
33:24
And the new Moon, the moon landing, you are the parametres of the age,
33:32
those parameters define how sick is, so you should think of lambda and US parametres.
33:41
And when I say no new moon, you are just Fatemi.
33:48
OK, so this would simply be the cube root of Sigma Cube.
33:54
When choose this. It shows that this vector that you obtain also belongs to it, so it is close and scalar multiplication as well.
34:03
OK. Again, an easy example.
34:15
What about in the same set? If I had defined instead of new cube, if I had said New Square, what would happen?
34:20
Anyone? Yeah.
34:31
All right. So sorry, it wasn't like I did not.
34:41
It can be negative, right? Stigma can be negative. So when you square and you take the square root.
34:53
Of stigmatising new squared when you take the square root of that, you will get a complex number, which is not in the.
35:02
So people on people and on Zoom, did you understand this?
35:15
This new example? Suppose I hired a new set. This morning, everything out.
35:24
Suppose I had to find a new stick, a star, let's say a star, which is the sake of all.
35:37
The same guy in the same similar definition, but instead of mute cube,
35:47
you have a new square, so you will get lambda lambda plus new square lambda minus new split.
35:50
Such that lambda and you are dialling numbers.
36:04
If I define this sick. This would not be a vector space because it won't be closed under scalar multiplication.
36:09
The reason is. If I start with an example, let's say.
36:24
Let's say Lambda is equal to one and music will do two.
36:33
All right. So.
36:39
One. One one plus four, one minus four obviously belongs to a star like.
36:45
This is interesting. Probably district disputes. No, it's not.
37:00
It's not. Anyway, I keep this as a home, but you can take it out because it will take me of a little time to to deduce.
37:08
But you will. You'll be able to show that it is not close on the scale of multiplication.
37:24
Yeah, yeah, pretty sure it should be possible.
37:32
Sigma Theta Sigma can be negative as it is expected that that's the reason that's the that you won't be able to have a new mule.
37:37
But I think there's a little bit of work that goes into brewing it.
37:48
OK. All right. So OK, so let's go to other examples.
37:55
Right. So what about be sustainable for a real estate and in this material, you can always be a business space like Scalabrine, always be available.
38:07
Yes. Because it is it. Was it the result of this loss?
38:21
That's correct. It's not. And the reason is that it's not exactly the same approach that I use for the other example.
38:28
So the said to be. Is not a vector space, because, again, it is not closed under scalar multiplication.
38:41
If you take any record and be. And then multiply it by minus one.
38:52
Then what you get won't be a victor in me.
39:00
Now, let's go to the third question, the third. Yeah, you can solve these problems, but yeah, go ahead.
39:06
Yes. Yes. That's correct. So the geometric interpretation.
39:23
So what would be the geometric interpretation of the first?
39:30
No, let me let me go back to that. Let me work it out for you.
39:38
So we had. A. Yeah.
39:47
We have a system which is defined as lambda lambda plus new you.
39:55
Lambda minus nuclear. Lambda and mule are real numbers.
40:02
OK, I can. We like this, Victor.
40:12
This any arbitrary Victor, as well as lambda times one one one.
40:18
Plus new queue times. Zero, one, minus one.
40:28
This this arbitrary Victor. OK, if I have to be a little formal about this, the way it should be is.
40:38
I will say. Let. Lambda lambda plus mutual lambda minus mutual.
40:54
Be and. Arbitrary. With the.
41:05
Belonging to a now the same thing. This can be denoted as this as a linear combination of.
41:18
Two vectors, which are one one one and zero one minus one.
41:30
And London Mutual Mutual. Or any can be any real numbers.
41:36
So it basically is what we saw this young boy or girl, one of the ones that.
41:45
OK, so that's what you are, what you're saying is that this would be a straight line.
41:57
They land against one one one. This is a straight line.
42:03
This isn't at a straight line. Right, it's.
42:10
It's a plane, exactly you're able to understand that when you have two reactors which are not in the same direction,
42:16
you know, I mean, we've come to that linear dependence and independence, it's the next topic.
42:24
So when you have to pick a different direction? Then there and then you take any linear combination of that,
42:31
you take all possible linear combinations of that and you will get a plane, a plane which is defined by this start and destructive.
42:39
And I've made it a little messy. But yeah, we will.
42:49
We will get to that. Yeah.
42:53
So this is going to be a plane. B was not B is not a weakness space, so geometric representation doesn't make sense.
42:57
C is a vector space. If lambda sorry, if gamma is is set to zero.
43:11
Otherwise, it's not a weak space. Can anyone tell me what? Suppose in see.
43:20
If I said Gama to be one, will it be a vector space? Look at the sea example, if I said Gama to be one, it won't be a vector space.
43:29
Yes, but it's that they want, but.
43:47
It will be closed if you are seeing GLOW. It will be closed under addition and multiplication.
43:59
Is that what is he? Zero.
44:05
Yeah. So zero is not an element in the sect.
44:11
If if I say lambda to be any number, any non-zero number, certainly not lambda gamma, if I said gamma to be any non-zero number.
44:16
It warns that despite this equation, the zero vector one side, despite this equation,
44:28
because on the left hand side, you have zero zero minus two times zero plus three times zero zero.
44:35
And on the right hand side, you will get a non-zero number. So you need to be zero for this space to be a factor space.
44:40
And then you then it's just a matter of ensuring that all the other close under additions and close down the scale of multiplication is satisfied,
44:52
but those other criteria has been satisfied. What about the.
45:04
The said be. Is this a big dispute?
45:11
The said be. Awake, the subspace of argue.
45:19
OK, I think you have probably does the Z symbol here, the set of integers.
45:28
Right, but they don't take that up with it.
45:38
Yeah. So if you yeah, can you just give an example of my gosh.
45:45
Oh yes, great. Yeah. But the final statement?
45:52
But yeah, it's like you said you might find that.
46:02
Yeah. Yeah, if you if you if you can define it in a way that ensures that the second element will always be an integer, then it's possible.
46:10
Yes. But. We are checking if it's a subspace of artery.
46:25
All right. So the same operations need to be and you are using the same operations which are used in a heartbeat to say yes,
46:32
the same and the same binary operational edition and the same scalar multiplication operation.
46:45
You can change operations. OK. Yeah.
46:52
All right. So now we have understood spaces and some spaces and some spaces.
46:57
And we will show it soon, but a week, the subspace will always be either a line or a vital part of our tree.
47:05
It will always be either a line passing through zero or a plane passing through zero.
47:17
It cannot be a good surface, if you can imagine geometrically.
47:23
And the reason is very simple, if it's if it if it goes.
47:30
Then you can always either identify or you can always find two vectors in that.
47:36
Curved surface. When you add those two vectors, it will be outside that of because of that curvature.
47:43
All right. So this is just developing an intuition. Yeah, is it?
47:52
That's what it's like. But those kind of planes are have a special name.
48:00
Those are fine spaces. But those are not rictus beasts.
48:07
You can see it. It's a vector space plus the constant.
48:16
So, yeah, let's let's put all I think it would be interesting if you draw a few examples here.
48:24
OK, so I have the. Sex.
48:32
The. Y-axis. And the Z-axis.
48:39
OK. And it's easy to understand.
48:47
First of all, if I have. Just the set.
48:53
Which has the zero, the the origin and nothing else.
49:01
OK. That would be that.
49:05
That's a trivial subspace. Right. Because.
49:09
Big, I need to elements in the SEC, so 0+ zero will be zero, so it's closed under ED. Scalar time zero will always be zero.
49:14
It's closer to scalar multiplication. Zero is part of the stick.
49:22
So it's a very trivial subspace. Now look at let's consider a line passing through an origin.
49:27
It could be any line. And one way to denote this set of this line passing through origin would be to take any any non-zero over.
49:33
OK, so let's say this is a non-zero vector, let's say four. It's probably.
49:48
Let's add this point as an example, is one to three.
49:58
This point is this. Victor, these are the coordinates of that point of that, Victor.
50:06
Now. This line. Is simply a scalar multiplication of this vector.
50:16
OK. I can find a point which is on this line by simply multiplying it with some scaling factor.
50:23
That's where the word scalar comes. It just takes over and does, elongates or squishes it or takes it in the opposite direction.
50:33
OK. So if this is any Vector X, then this point is lambda times x, some lambda for some lambda.
50:42
So this is the line. Is it close under ED. You can see visually, right, if you have two actors on that line?
50:56
This arrange them from point to the at the end of the arrow and the starting point of the other.
51:07
And you will find the point on this line.
51:18
So it's closed and the radiation is it closed, a scalar multiplication, yes, by definition, like a line is just scaling the.
51:21
And the origin is that so a lion is a subspecies. Is a plane passing through the origin subspace?
51:29
Again, yes, you can visualise if a big group recurs in that plane,
51:37
if any linear combination of those two vectors, again, I'm not defending, it comes and goes next.
51:42
If you if you scale and scale up to it is an act, then you will get you recover the plane.
51:50
So yeah, and now here is the interesting result which we've been through at some stage.
52:01
It will be just now I'm taking you back to linear algebra that.
52:13
Any subspace? Of odd and.
52:21
It's a OK. If.
52:28
We is subspace. Of any.
52:35
Is the same as seeing. We is the solution sect.
52:44
Of some system of linear equations.
53:00
So some homogenous system of genetic patients in that are in.
53:08
OK. It's only don't leave statement. OK.
53:17
Let's take a closer look at this statement, but obviously it's very straightforward to show that this reverse implication.
53:26
If. If I have.
53:38
X equals zero. OK.
53:44
And in the first exercise, you know how to how to deduce the solution of this system of linear equations.
53:49
It was just Gaussian elimination. Get the reduced rate landfall.
53:56
Try to simplify it and get the solution set of all solutions for this system of linear equations, right?
54:02
That sick is. Now what we need to show that SEC is should be closed under will consist the zero right because eight times.
54:14
Zero vector is equal to zero, right? So this implies that zero vector belongs to its.
54:28
Right now, if you take any two elements in, is the solution set off this system of linear equations?
54:41
Oops! Let.
54:49
Vector X and Y belong to us, which is to say that a X equals zero and a Y equals zero.
55:00
And this implies that E of X plus y.
55:12
Equal zeal. And this implies.
55:19
That. X plus y also belongs to this is this.
55:24
So it's close under ED. It's also close and the scalar multiplication.
55:35
OK, easy to see eight times. Ends Lambda Lambda IX is same as Lambda Times a X, which is seen as Lambda Times zero, which is zero.
55:39
So it's close and scalar multiplication goes under vector addition, and the zero is also a solution.
55:57
So this also answers your original question. You said, what about the plane, which is not passing through Warwick to?
56:06
It won't be a solution to a system of. It won't be a solution to a homogenous system of genetic questions.
56:14
Yeah. OK, so so what did we show?
56:24
We showed that a for any matrix a.
56:30
Not so we saw that for any system of any system of equations.
56:36
Homogeneous, which isn't, which means that the black vector,
56:41
which is on the right hand side of the equation is a zero vector, the solution of that system of linear equation,
56:43
the sake of all solutions of that equations forms a subspace of order in which it, whichever in which other spaces, solutions that is embedded.
56:50
The other way around is a slightly more involved approach, and for that, we will have to define bases and linear combination.
57:06
I was hoping to cover linear combinations, but I guess I am running out of time.
57:15
We will do linear combinations on Wednesday. All right. And bases and generating bases and all those concepts.
57:20
All right. Thank you. I'll see you on Wednesday. Thanks.
57:29
Thank you. Yeah, I got it.
