Title: DM Nov 2 Lecture Recording
Category: Discrete Mathematics
Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 05/11/2021
OK, we are recording now. We left off on Thursday by starting to discuss the concept of functions,
0:09
and we have given the definition of functions as a relation between two sets so
0:22
that every element in the first set corresponds to an element in the second set.
0:31
And if there are two elements in the second set, then that relate to an element in the first set, then they have to be the same sort of function.
0:36
Never met an element to two different things. So if a release satisfies those two criteria, it is a function.
0:49
If it doesn't satisfy the criteria that every element in the first set gets related to another.
0:58
The second set, then, is called partial function.
1:04
We've defined injector functions as subjective functions and by actions, and we are now on the point of checking a few details.
1:08
So injected function one to one states that the two different elements in the first set
1:20
have different items in the second set related to the On2 or subsection specifies that.
1:27
It's both. So the first property to be rejected, this is just proves discussions,
1:44
I'll give you the essential things that you have to think of India right under the form of loans.
1:50
The sort of first one says that so if a function is A., Then the number of elements function from A to B,
1:56
then a number of elements in a smaller equals than the elements of B.
2:04
And my argument for the correctness of these statements is that it is the positive that pigeonhole principle and business sort of to positive.
2:09
First of all, so says that if you know that P implies Q, then that is equivalent to say that not Q implies not B, as well as the contrary positive.
2:18
And what we have here is to pigeonhole principle pigeonhole principle says.
2:30
If you have too many, if you have more elements than books, then eat alone.
2:34
Books contain at least two elements to record.
2:41
The positive of that is if each element contains one, each box contains one elements, then you have you do not have more elements than boxes.
2:44
So this is exactly the thing that a mistake density the boxes are the elements that you map onto,
2:57
and the elements are the the things that you get from. OK, second property.
3:03
My keyboard is disconnected, that music, yeah, yeah. So we you remark, first of all, that the image of a on the EV is exactly B now.
3:13
And we have seen on a previous result that the there are more elements or equal in the domain than there are in the image set,
3:25
and therefore this result follows immediately from that result.
3:36
Now, because the. The size of the image, so this is exactly the size of me, OK?
3:40
And the last one, if you have it by U.S. and the size of two sides equal, then this is of course, the result of these two properties together.
3:47
So no, this sort of formula just for finite sets,
3:59
because then I can talk about the number of elements exactly if it is infinite, then it's a little bit more tricky.
4:02
But we will see that we can generate a notion of carnality to infinite jest as well.
4:09
And this basically comes back. Yeah, so we say that. So then having objection between two sets will become the definition of the
4:14
fact that the size is the same as we've checked play an important role that.
4:23
So asset relations that can compose functions,
4:31
the only confusing thing is that the notation is slightly different in this because of the way in which the things are read.
4:34
First of all, let me define function composition.
4:41
So if I have a function with F in G, which have to correct type in the sense that I have mentioned to B and C MEPs from B now,
4:45
so I'd have to set a common then I can compose Chee with F and this is pronounced chee after.
4:53
And as a function from A to C and the definition of that straightforward I apply G.
5:01
After F to a by first applying, after aiding and abetting cheated result of then please remember that this symbol there means is defined as you know.
5:07
So this is an equality that is not established. But is this inequality this immediate by by replacing them?
5:17
So this is not the same as to what is, for example, you can say Stefan is a lecturer,
5:25
but then you can't replace in a sentence that has a lecture by Stefan.
5:32
That would be wrong, but you can say Stefan is the guy in office four to five, because that's uniquely determined.
5:38
So you can define me as the guy who occupies office four to five in Huxley.
5:45
So there is in natural language and the equals in in mathematics, that's not the same thing.
5:51
Now you have to be very careful with these properties.
5:59
So whenever I want to stress that equality follows by definition, I put a little triangle on top.
6:01
It's not required because equality holds anyway, but it's just to highlight that it is by definition.
6:08
Good. So the criteria that this is a function to the definitions when I started, they're very easy to check.
6:16
It's a pretty straightforward love of writing. I might put this in the next to be.
6:23
And the sort of go domain of f is the same as the domain of G.
6:30
So as I said, we have to be there and we have to be there.
6:35
That's important. Otherwise you can't build a competition.
6:38
And you can we can add a little bit per say, well, this this go domain should be a subset of that domain,
6:42
but it's for the moment to just insist that the artist name.
6:48
So the difference between relation function composition is the order in which the symbols occur now.
6:53
So for example, if I have here are composed for this, then I take a pear in an R and a pear and as.
6:59
On so he over in ah, on the left hand side and the buy in is on the right hand side and the conveys a
7:11
combination of these two groups upon the competition in the function composition,
7:19
this is swapped. So I have a function. If I express this, I still exist and immediate.
7:23
Be such that then the first item says that the AB should be an f and B C should be in G so d, so please be marked and function composition.
7:30
The order in which these symbols occur is what some people say.
7:41
Well, you should have a different symbol there, and if you go to the literature, there are people who do that.
7:48
They have for function, composition, different symbol, then for racial composition,
7:53
for example, for religion, composition to take the circle of thought in the middle.
7:58
I've decided to not do that because it will be clear from the context of the composition is that we're talking about.
8:02
So as an example of function composition, take these two functions F and G,
8:14
defined by one two eight two three three two eight and then eight to come and B to Alpha.
8:19
And then you can draw a diagram very easily, and the composition just moves one to become a total and three to come now.
8:25
So it is not a subjective function.
8:32
You could argue immediately it is impossible to have a bite from A to C through B because B is only two elements and therefore it won't work.
8:35
Good. I had a question in the busload or that by having you U.S. choice of every crank of my volume because I can't hear you very well,
8:48
just please repeat in the second function, G, you've not used the C like that.
8:59
There is. There exists no image for C. So is it is still a function from B to C.
9:07
Yes, it is. It's just not subjective.
9:15
That is not a well-defined function or a G is a function, of course, the two criteria for the function are all the elements in B have an emergency.
9:20
That's correct. And none of the elements in G are meant to two elements in C.
9:29
And that's correct. But C doesn't have an image.
9:35
The element was it's very C. I don't see C. I'm seeing the in the said B.
9:40
The small C element doesn't have an image. I don't see you see it.
9:46
Do we have the we have a different slide image. Is there a C here for you?
9:51
At the top? Let a definition of said B o u.
9:57
OK, does the one OK? Yeah, so I found off. That's a mistake to see.
10:01
Should not be there. That's just a slip up now.
10:05
OK, thank you very much for that. I can put the C in there and then it is no longer a function.
10:09
But in the diagram, the CS mentions that a diagram is correct is a function.
10:18
But you're right this this c there should not be there. Thank you for that.
10:21
I'll correct it. Good. So we go do a little exercise here.
10:25
The first one is a reconstruction and the second one is a little proof.
10:32
And so I'm going to give you 10 minutes to work on these.
10:37
And what I want you to do is want to.
10:41
Now, so that if the combination of two functions is injected and the first one should be and I want you to construct and two functions of so set,
10:44
the composition is injected for years, not now.
10:57
So this is not so extras always injected as competition is, but she doesn't need to be.
11:01
OK, I'll give you 10 minutes and then I'll come back and do the exercise for you.
11:08
You know, the first one was very small proof. It's five lines or so.
11:16
It's pretty straightforward. So please make sure that you use in in your attempt.
11:20
You use what this stands for. Yeah. So this is a pretty good being one to one, and that's the thing.
11:25
So it becomes a formula. You have to show that formula now.
11:31
So don't start reasoning about a thing in words.
11:34
And there's a formula that you need to show. See you.
11:39
And then. And I think the slides have gone.
11:42
Stefan, are you meeting speaker? I sorry, I forgot to switch on my microphone.
20:07
Yeah, so recap the so what you need to show.
20:14
Is this this implication here? The goal is on the right hand side on the left hand side is a an assumption that you can use.
20:19
The thing that I cancelled out is how you do not start to prove you don't start by saying, OK, let's take something that is the is one to one.
20:27
You need to focus on what it is that you have to show. Now this is this is the focus of the book.
20:35
So what I wrote on here is what I have to show. I have to show off one to one.
20:40
So I need to show that satisfies this, this property. This is for all you will need to it.
20:44
So I take two of them. I now need to show this application. And again, at the end, this is what I have to show and this is what I can use now.
20:51
So in this particular case, I say, OK now as soon. So now we can safely assume because I'm I don't have any.
21:03
Implications inside anymore, so assume that everyone is equal to f of eight.
21:13
OK, now what can I use now? I want to. I want to conclude that only two are the same,
21:19
but I have no information other than the other thing that's been given is that I have a composition of two functions that is injected,
21:24
which means that if I now apply G to these two things, I can, so I get the composition of G.
21:33
And if they want to see what the competition g of overlap they do, so then I would have to be able to do it.
21:41
Assume so that would be good. So let's see, apply G.
21:46
To both, yeah. Then first of all, can I write this down?
21:53
Is this sorry? Is this a safe thing to say?
21:58
Yeah. Are these equal? So notice that I haven't written it with the little circle there, but just apply Jews to the left and the right hand side.
22:03
And the answer is yes, these are equal because two years of function, it maps everything to one image.
22:14
These things are the same and therefore just assume with them. Yeah.
22:21
So here since she is the function. Good.
22:25
So therefore, I now I use the fact that I have my composition, so.
22:35
So also, she asked if on the run, she asked if when they do so, a woman is equal to a two because she asked if she one one.
22:45
So I have shown my goal. I have shown it.
23:06
Want to have a say no.
23:10
So this proof uses the assumption that these are equal and that it concludes that these are equal so that if then statement is in this proof.
23:14
OK, so this is done. But in exam question in many years, very nice, if you know what you're doing, it's it's a minute.
23:26
And if you don't know what you're doing, it's half an hour.
23:40
So it's very good that you practise in these little exercises where you prepare for the exam.
23:43
I think I'll leave the other number three and four and five for the P.A.
23:50
So let me go to number two here. No, so I need to give an example of three cents A, B and C, and I want to function have.
23:56
Here and often the function key there, and I want to go position to be injected.
24:15
But the the and the gene not OK, so I need a function, so I need at least three elements there and I need to link them through F and G.
24:23
OK, so there's the minimum requirement or otherwise I don't have a function.
24:37
So what I want now is that if I look at this composition, all the composition is subjective.
24:42
That's OK. Everything A.G is indicated. So that's too much.
24:48
I want a need to add a little bit more because I want it to be not interactive.
24:53
So what I do is I add the second element there, and I meant that to the first on that.
24:57
So now I have a non-objective function there, and the composition of F.A. is.
25:03
So a very small example. So normally students start talking about, well, take away from end to end slaughter.
25:12
And it makes something very elaborate. And but there's nothing wrong with it, but I've seen a lot of these things go wrong.
25:21
And so the it's not always safe path to try and think in terms of functions on the on big,
25:28
infinite sets and partial function because students often write something down, which is no longer a function because it's partial and said No, no.
25:35
So whenever I asked for function, I especially want a function, not a partial function.
25:43
OK. Good. I hope this is clear we can move back to the slides.
25:49
Area, yes.
26:12
The the proof of three and four. So force as as and two is a very small example.
26:16
And the proof of five, you checked the criteria for being checked.
26:23
If so, you check that FSG are both competitive, both injected and and subjective.
26:29
If the F and G have both it again, not not a lot of work, but you have to be precise and make sure that you make the right steps.
26:37
OK, good.
26:47
So the nice thing about this function composition is that one of the properties that holds that it is so stiff.
26:51
So it doesn't matter how I put the brackets in the functional composition, I got the same result.
26:57
And for example, the the thing that I'm going to do is here for three functions that age after she asked
27:02
that if it's the same as age after off after and this equality between functions.
27:08
So this is not an equality by definition, this is an equality. It has to be established.
27:16
And how is the equality of functions defined? It is by saying they do the same thing on all the possible inputs now.
27:21
So both these function compositions are functions from A to D.
27:31
So I have to show that if I launch the right one on an element of a an allowance,
27:37
so the element of an nonce, the right one on element of a I get the same thing.
27:43
So OK, let's let's launch it on an element of a note.
27:49
Take an arbitrary element. Then I look up the definition of the symbol there.
27:54
So this is the one on the on the outside. I apply that one.
27:59
So I get that this is the same as h applied to the function composition of G after I've applied to any.
28:04
So I've put some additional brackets in there, I don't need to put this in there,
28:12
but are there for readability to make sure that you see the grouped and I apply this definition again.
28:17
So these are steps that followed by definition as no reasoning evolved.
28:25
There's nothing involved in this. Just go to the definition and replace the symbol by what it what it is defined this.
28:29
So I've got this triple function composition.
28:37
I know I reinsert the the function composition symbol, but now in a different order, I first who is going to be on side.
28:39
So I replace that one there and I put in the little circle and I have a function applied
28:48
to the function applied to a so I can do that for that function composition as well.
28:54
And I got this thing back. OK, so I have to do these. Two things are all the same by definition.
29:00
So therefore they are equal. And this is true for all a and therefore the function on the left applied is to function on the right applied.
29:05
Yeah. So this is how you establish function equality.
29:14
So sometimes it's possible to do reasonable functions of the same without having access to what you actually did actually do.
29:20
A particular kind of function that is related to stuff that we've done for relations is the identity function and the inverse function.
29:30
So the identity function and he said ayesta and the function that every element unto itself.
29:40
Yeah, subjective and injunctive and thereby objection almost for free.
29:46
We can talk about the inverse as a function that satisfies two criteria.
29:55
Now, so g is the inverse of F, and if G exists, then we write G as F to the power minus one.
30:00
So if it satisfies two criteria, the first criterion is what is called it is a left inverse.
30:10
So if you do, the left composition would f you get identity on a and if you do the right composition on on F, we should set criteria.
30:17
You get the identity and b not so g apply to f of a is a.
30:28
And I've applied to G of B is b. Yeah. So it is expressed here that the composition, identity and a and the other one identity on B No.
30:34
So if you can find a G to does this, then the function as an inverse because not all functions, you can't do this for possible functions.
30:45
For example, if I have a function that maps one or two both to one,
30:55
then I I cannot find the inverse so I can find the inverse relation to says once MeCP2 one and two is in relation with one's in relation to two.
31:03
But that is no the function boost and the one is related to both volume two.
31:17
If the inverse relation is a function, then it is automatically also the inverse function.
31:24
OK. So an example that you universe exists, if I take a message one beat,
31:32
it was easy to do and then I just flipped the pass and then get the inverse relation.
31:39
And this is the inverse function because if I apply g to after a plate two one one two eight eight eight three two three three to be so b to B, etc.
31:45
So if I take a bite injection, then I can actually create the inverse immediately.
32:02
They say, Well, I think first of B is equal to a whenever f of aids equal to be done.
32:11
So I just flip the bears in the relation, as I suggested by the thing we did on the previous slide.
32:20
And the. So this relation that I'm defining here is as a well-defined function.
32:27
I have to have to argue that if the projection, if f is a projection and this construction that I'm doing here by flipping the pan.
32:34
First of all, gives me a function and I have to show that it is the inverse.
32:43
OK. I skipped the part here that it is a.
32:48
No. Let me share with you what it is that I'm doing, it looks like that music.
32:57
So I need to argue that it is the inverse I do on the next slide.
33:16
The I need to show here that it is a function, so I need to check that all the elements in B are related to an element in a.
33:20
Yeah. So that's. And no two elements in a are related to by the same element in B.
33:32
OK. Well taken element in which I need now to prove that there is an element in a that f inverse relates this b to.
33:39
I know that F is on two because its objection. So I know the confined in a sort of a b and I can flip therefore despair around
33:49
and say that B admits to to a on the evidence was so that's that's good.
34:01
Every element in B as in alignment in aid associated to to argue that f inverse is a function,
34:07
I need to show that one element in B is not related to two elements in a well, if there is one element in be related to two elements in a,
34:18
then I have an instance of f of a willingness to say if every one equals to B equals to f of a dude and everyone's equal to as a two,
34:29
and therefore the function would not be in A. any more so.
34:41
I know that for every element in B, there can only be one element in a death is mapped to it.
34:48
So the aid I'm found in there is unique. So by those two criteria, I know the universe is function.
34:55
Yeah. So again, I should have written Sketchier because it's very short.
35:05
OK. And of course, it satisfies the the condition for B,
35:10
and it was because if you put this f inverse inside to the definition that we had that we had here,
35:15
you will see that this does exactly these to these two equalities.
35:23
OK, so the thing to check is that it is an inverse and it does the the thing that is required.
35:30
So I now show that if a function has it in her.
35:41
Sorry, I ask a question. Yes. So for a definition of even worse,
35:47
why we need to have to equality to make sure it's because because there are two two different concepts
35:53
that there is the goods that are being a left inverse and the concept of being a right inverse.
36:00
So first and foremost, it should be both a flu shot and infers it has satisfies both, but you can, for example, say, if decisive, so.
36:07
So if the inverse exists, you are dealing with the objection. The size of about the same is the size of B, not the same.
36:17
Then you can have only a left inverse, or you can have only a write in votes.
36:24
Okay. Yeah. So the inverse requires both left and right.
36:30
So the two criteria now, so the fact that a b, if same size then is a result of both these things being true.
36:35
So actually, what you get is you have to. There was this yeah, so you get the shot, you get for the left and you get, for example,
36:42
but this criterium and for the right to vote, you get that because the need for the infoods, you get these criteria, huh?
36:53
Yeah. So you need both to get the equality and sense.
37:01
So if a function, so the next thing to do is show that if and if it is a function has has an inverse,
37:09
then it this objection and the inverse is unique now.
37:17
So it is an important study being by A. And being a vertical becomes the same thing.
37:20
First of all, I so I take a function that is from A to B.
37:27
I know that it has an inverse. And I first showed it is untrue.
37:32
And so I try to show that this is by ejection needs show it is subjective and injected official the subjective.
37:37
I take an element in B show that maps onto it.
37:45
I know that a g of B so due to right inverse of of f and therefore this equality holds.
37:48
And so this thereby automatically there exists an element in B No.
37:57
And A which is g of B, which by F gets meant to be.
38:05
So you have found an element in a that admission to B therefore BS in the image of F.
38:11
So remark that GOP there that's an element of a.
38:18
To show that it is invective, we take two elements in a and you need to show that if we assume that the images are the same,
38:24
then the elements are the same as well. This is very similar to what was done before the we apply g to the left and the right argument.
38:32
A function and the so this is well-defined.
38:43
It should give me the same element because I know that it is a left inverse and therefore it is identity on the composition.
38:47
So this means that these two things are the same.
38:57
So on this on the right are the same and by consequence consequences that the the erroneous the same as a two Yankee and official identity.
39:00
So I assume that is available legal to enforce a two and therefore follows that everyone is equal to a two and thereby F is injectors.
39:12
No. So and if we function, it has an inverse is a projection.
39:22
That's a good thing. I only need to know that it has a unique inverse.
39:27
So the there is not another function that is an inverse as well.
39:31
So now I assume that there is another one, there's an inference as well.
39:35
Then I know that these qualities both also pick an element in the ego domain and end the function composition of effigy and therefore G Prime,
39:40
because they're both left. The inverse so right in versus this should be the same.
39:52
So both identity and therefore this is both B equals B and therefore because efficient and objective function cannot map two different elements to
39:57
the same thing and thereby I know the GMB and G of G Prime would be also the same element in a so for every B G and G Prime do the same thing,
40:08
they might do the same element and therefore these are the same function. Good.
40:20
Questions. Oh, I hear Mike coming open, no.
40:31
OK. So as an example, Tony, as an example, a function from national numbers.
40:36
Yeah. So you say it's all facts is X plus one.
40:46
If X is even an f x mine is one of the factors other than the composition of effort itself gives identity.
40:51
So you do that by considering the other, you've separately thereby emphasis on inverse.
41:00
Yeah, because it immediately left and right the inverse here.
41:06
Yeah, because we don't know which of these two arms is the one that we are calling the inverse.
41:12
And therefore, you know that I have this objection. Yeah.
41:18
So so you can check that official objection through checking that it is subjective and injected, which is quite a bit of work.
41:22
Or you can immediately right down here say, Well, actually, it's it's it's all inverse, so it has an inverse and therefore it is 0.6.
41:31
Good. So we can use this the notion of by ejection to define to to extend our notion of continuity.
41:46
And we do that by saying that we consider sets to be equivalent and then we will define them as having the same size.
41:58
If objection exists between them now,
42:09
so this equivalence symbol there now is a double equivalent symbol in the literature you will find is what a single equivalence.
42:12
I've used a double equivalence to distinguish it from equivalence relations on sense,
42:20
although this can be defined to behave like an equivalence relation.
42:27
It is not that equivalence relation because it is not a relation, because it's all sense.
42:31
So this is the oldest scary thing in medicine that the collection of all sets is not a scent.
42:37
And so officially, this is not a relation. It is just a property between sets.
42:43
Good. So this is defined by saying there exist.
42:51
And if you remember that this is an element notation and I can replace this by the emphasis is going to be placed, but a formal definition?
42:54
Yeah. So. It satisfies the criteria of an equivalence solution.
43:03
So what I saw? It is not an agribusiness relation.
43:10
I can't stress this enough because the collection of all service is not a set, but it behaves like an equivalence remains.
43:14
Like, for example, we can show that this relation satisfies the predictors of being reflexive, symmetric and trans. So if we do that?
43:23
No, first of all, we need to show that it is reflexive.
43:34
So we need to show that for every element, a there is an objection from A to A,
43:38
and that's easy because we know that the identity function exists and that's the objection by almost by definition.
43:44
So this abuse for free. So this relation is reflexive.
43:52
It is symmetric because if I have an objection from A to B, then by what we've done in the previous slides,
43:57
I know that the inverse is a projection as well, from B to A.
44:06
And therefore there exist objection from B day and therefore be equivalent to a.
44:11
And third one, yeah, that is religion is transitive,
44:19
follows from the fact that the composition of both directions is a projection and this also a property, we've established a few slides back now.
44:24
So the this is all a good property, so we can reason about the equivalence between sets as if it is an equivalence relation.
44:35
And it makes it makes it good. So this is you can you can say so this is like inequality.
44:46
Remember that equivalence relations are equating things that are not synthetically the same.
44:52
So you can have sets that are very different here. But in this relation, you can say, Well, I considered them the same.
44:59
And this is crucial in mathematics, where a lot of people identify sets only by the number of elements they have now.
45:05
So that's the it's an important property. So for example, we can have that the oh, the blue.
45:13
So these two sets are equivalent, generate both two elements.
45:21
We even have a particular property and this can be used in exercises you do.
45:26
So it is not something I will show. It's quite quite a big proof.
45:31
And we only need a property. So if we have to inject it functions or two or such active functions from A to B and from B to A,
45:35
then E A and B are equivalent sort of exist to bind S. And so from the two injections that exist or from the two such actions that exist,
45:45
you can actually construct objection.
45:54
Now, another example of equivalence is that a set of natural numbers and the set of even numbers, those are two equivalent sets.
45:58
Yeah, there is a by election between those two. Of course, the first one is a of subset of the first one.
46:09
But that's not the quality. And here the continuum is going to find objection and the answer is yes.
46:17
Similarly, all the prime numbers form a set that is equivalent to the set of natural numbers close to an infinitely many primes, very short proof.
46:23
Perhaps I can do that. Next week, we will unveil on Thursday.
46:39
So I said next week, there is no next week. On Thursday, I will focus on these qualities.
46:45
These equivalencies between between sets.
46:53
So I will argue that and the set of natural numbers and set of all the integers there I have, there is objection there.
46:56
There is objection between the set of numbers and a set of Obama's official numbers.
47:05
There's an equivalence between initial numbers and rationales. Yeah.
47:10
So you can argue that these are sites that have roughly the same size.
47:15
Yeah, we can also show that this set of natural numbers is equivalent to the.
47:19
And so this is a way of saying that V is finite.
47:26
So I find an end such that the size of V is endless, an expression of views of finite set.
47:31
And I take all this subset of end at a finite. So the set of initial numbers is equivalent to the set of all the finer subsets of N now.
47:38
So it is quite quite a big jump here.
47:47
You think in size, but is not the same number. But for example, we can also show that and and the sub and the POW set of and they are not equivalent.
47:50
You can actually show that there is no objection and that and and ah, so to set it all reals are not equivalent.
48:01
OK, we will come to those on Thursday. We talk about infinity.
48:09
OK. That's it for today. Any questions left?
48:18
If not, I'll I'll stop recording. And we will see each other on Thursday.
48:29
I can comfortably finish my material. There are 14 slides I can even talk floating on Thursday.
48:36
We'll make time for some exercises and then the I will discuss the the accountability definition with you.
