Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova

Hello and welcome to the fifth lecture of introduction to Computer Systems, so remember that we just saw how to work with.
0:06
Binary equations. Boolean equation's, excuse me,
0:16
and we saw how to construct circuits from these equations or from truth tables and also how to build equations and truth tables from circuits.
0:20
But as you can remember from the last slide in the previous lecture, those techniques were not sufficient to find the best or smallest circuit.
0:32
So what we were going to do in this lecture is talk about some techniques that build on top of
0:43
what we already know that will lead us one step closer into building these minimal circuits.
0:49
And we are going to start with the Kanani canonical forms of combinatorial circuits.
0:55
So let me start by describing what the combinatorial circuit is,
1:02
and those are circuits where the right hand side of the equation that describes the circuit does not appear on the left hand side of that equation.
1:06
So, for example, here we have our here that is equal to this other part of the equation.
1:17
And basically it means that the result R is a combination of the inputs that we have on the right side.
1:25
And this would also be another example, but note that this would not fall under the definition because our appears on both sides.
1:32
So this means that combinatorial circuits do not have any cycles in them.
1:43
And later on, we'll see when cycles are useful and why.
1:49
But for now, we are just going to stay with these combinatorial circuits that, again, have no cycles.
1:53
So now let's jump into what canonical forms are so the definition would be that a canonical form is a standard way of writing an equation.
2:00
So it is kind of a standardised shape or form of an equation, because remember,
2:10
there's many ways in which we can express circuit with different equations that they are all equivalent.
2:17
So the economic reform basically gives us a set of rules so that we can have we can read an equation that
2:24
is always going to be the same as long as we follow those rules with a given initial equation or circuit.
2:33
Now, the reason why this is useful is because of what I just said,
2:39
if we cannot nikolais equations, then we can check if they have the same canonical form.
2:43
It means the two equations are exactly the same, are expressing the same logic or.
2:49
And also, we will later see how these economic reforms, we can then use them to find the minimum implementation of a circuit,
2:57
which is one of the interesting points that we want to get out of this.
3:05
So the first part we're going to look at for colonialisation or canonical forms of Boolean equations is
3:10
something called midterm's and omentum is or minimum term a simply product term that is a conjunction,
3:17
a set of ends that contain each input of the equation.
3:27
So remember, that's the right hand side of the equation and it's going to contain each of the input variables or its negation.
3:32
So if we have three variables, B, and seeing all these possibilities here would be midterm's.
3:40
It's A and B and C another. Mintern would be A and not being seen and so forth.
3:48
So if we have, for example, not B, I'm not saying that would not be a mean term,
3:54
because remember, we have three inputs in this example and A is missing here.
3:59
So that would not be a midterm. Now,
4:03
let's look at how we can Nikolai's billion equation using these midterms and the whole
4:08
idea here is that canonical minturn form of an equation is a combination of logic.
4:17
We're simply we are going to have a sum of midterm's, so that's basically if we are using other words at this junction of conjunctions,
4:26
which with an example, it's going to seem you're going to see how easy it really is.
4:37
So we have here a conjunction as the what we are on the Innosight 14.
4:43
Because remember the conjunction of presidents, so we have a conjunction with all the inputs into different forms.
4:51
And then all of this is at this junction, our operation.
5:01
So this is a canonical minturn form of an equation, and remember, this equation is expressing some logical circuit or logic function.
5:06
So I remember again, because of the terms that while this is a valid Valliant equation, it expresses a circuit or a valid logic function.
5:18
This is not a mean term because as you can see, we have A, B and C as inputs.
5:32
But this is missing and C and this one is missing A.
5:37
So this is not canonical means and is not in canonical minturn form, even though both of them these are valid boolean equations.
5:41
Now, on the other side, we will also have canonical Maxtor forms, which are kind of the opposite,
5:53
using the principle of duality, as we already saw in the lecture.
6:01
Number four in the previous lecture.
6:07
So remember, in one of the what we are going what we are doing is basically swapping and the Knauss so that all of the canonical means,
6:09
the form is, of course, the canonical Maxtor form with after swapping these engines or.
6:18
So in this case, as we see in this example, it's the product of deductions.
6:27
And this is also an equation for him that is useful in circuit design and analysis.
6:34
We will take. So now let's see how these canonical forms relate to the truth tables that we already saw.
6:42
And one of the useful features of this economic reforms is that they can be used
6:53
very easily to find the following equation that corresponds to a truly stable.
7:00
So what we have is that mean term.
7:06
We'll evaluate to one for exactly one of the possible combinations of its input variables, because we are talking about a combination of circuits.
7:10
Remember, it has a set of variables. There is an input and then it has an output.
7:20
So we are going to have that minimum wage to one, for example, one of the possible combination of variables and it's going to be zero everywhere else.
7:27
So in this case, we're not A and B and C equals one if and only if that's what this event means if
7:38
and only if a zero vs one and C is one and this midterm is going to evaluate,
7:48
evaluate to zero. Otherwise, in any other case, that is that doesn't follow these conditions.
7:56
So knowing this, you will see now how easy it is to build this midterms out of truth table.
8:03
So let's see here, for example, a very simple majority vote circuit,
8:11
which basically what we want is we have here three input variables which are, let's say to the voters and one output variable.
8:16
That is the result. And we want our to be one whenever the majority of the inputs are one.
8:29
So that means whenever two or more of the inputs are one.
8:37
Now, remember what I just said about mean terms?
8:41
They are we are going to have one midterm for every single case, the input combination where the output is one.
8:44
So in this case, the midterm would be not A and B and C because A zero, B is one and C is one.
8:54
And in this case, it's exactly the same. The midterm is eight because this is one not being because it's zero and C because it's one and so forth.
9:03
And so we just need to look at the result column,
9:13
look for all the ones and then write down the Mendham that we have now when we once we have each of them in terms for each of the result combinations,
9:17
for the input combinations and on a result,
9:30
that is one finding the boolean equation that is going to express this truthfully is basically ordering all these midterms together,
9:32
because remember, each of these midterms is going to be one when it matches the combination that it's referring to.
9:44
But in that case, all the other midterms will be zero.
9:53
So when this one this one here is one, all these midterms here will be zero.
9:57
So, again, like we saw in the previous example on the on the last election and number four,
10:03
we can or together other substitutes for midterms in this case and know that like in the multiplex
10:11
or case seems in each of the midterms is going to be one when all the other midterms are zero.
10:21
If we are all together, we have the result that we wanted,
10:27
which is an equation that is going to be one whenever each of these cases happens, which is the ones that we identified with the midterms.
10:31
OK, great. So if we want to use the mux terms is very similar to what we have in this case instead of things we are looking at the duality case,
10:41
we for customs, we are going to look for cases where R is zero.
10:56
And in this case, the Maxtor is going to be expressed as A or B or C in this case, because it's zero four zero or zero.
11:02
Now, whenever we have one, we basically are negating this one because we are looking for zero.
11:14
So the maximum is going to be A or B or not C.
11:20
Then once we have all these Moctar maximums, we basically andam.
11:25
Together, which is exactly what we have done here.
11:32
So we have the first Moxham here, A or B or C and the next Moxham A or B or not C and off and so forth,
11:36
for all the maxims that we have for these two stable of the majority voted circuit.
11:46
And in both cases they are both equations are equivalent.
11:52
It's just that one is in canonical Mintern form.
11:57
The previous one that we saw here, because it's a conjunction of disjunctions.
12:01
And this one, it's in canonical lexton form because as we can see, it's at this junction of conjunctions.
12:07
Gret. Now, how do we find the canonical form of an equation that we already have,
12:16
because what we saw right now is how to get the canonical form of truth table, but in other cases, we want to have the canonical form of an equation.
12:23
So this is perfectly possible just by using the algebraic formulas.
12:35
For Boolean equation algebra that we learn on the previous lecture.
12:42
And all we have to do is, for example, if we are looking at the Chronicle, I mean, to get it in a shape where it's a conjunction of destructions.
12:50
So we start applying the rules. We know, like, for example, we know that a or not A is always going to be one.
12:58
And we know that whatever we say, a sorry excuse me one and something else that's always going to be is something else.
13:07
Those are two rules that we already learnt. So in this case, we can simply take this one over here.
13:16
It is, and then we take this B and C put it here and ended with this one that we know is neutral, it's ending it with one.
13:23
So it really has no effect on changing the meaning of the equation.
13:33
But once we have this now, we can apply the distributive property of the.
13:38
Of the operations, so we end up with this, which now financially it is in canonical minturn form,
13:45
so as you can see, going from any equation to economical reform, we can do it with the rules that we already know.
13:54
And once we have two different equations in canonical minturn form or canonical maximum for both of them have to be on the same form.
14:03
We can compare them and see if they are the same or not.
14:10
So now let's go for that third case, which is finding the canonical form of a circuit.
14:17
So as we already know, we already learn how to go from a circuit like the one here into describing it, using a boolean equation.
14:23
And all we have to do then is do all the apply all the rules that we already know until we get to the canonical form.
14:36
Just a clarification that I've forgotten.
14:50
The previous line is that when we are multiplying or ending here with C or not seeing which remember, this is always one by definition,
14:53
this is also called augmentation, just so that whenever you see this term being used in the next likes, this is exactly what it means.
15:03
So excellent. Just to wrap up about kononenko forms, what we can see is that.
15:15
We can very easily obtain them in a very optimistic, automated way from two tables and pretty easily from boolean equations and circuits,
15:24
but also we can see that the canonical form is not always the smallest circuit representation, which is our ultimate goal.
15:35
But as we will see on the next part, canonical form is actually used as a stepping stone in automated design analysis and circuits.
15:47
And that's exactly what we are going to see in the next part,
15:57
which is how to go from here and actually minimise circuit to at its minimal representation.
16:00
And with this, I will see you on the next part.
16:08
