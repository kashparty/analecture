Title: Induction over Numbers - 4
Category: 1 - Induction over Numbers
Lecturer: Sophia Drossopoulou
Date: 23/01/2021
Welcome to our fourth session on induction of numbers. What will we be doing?
0:02
This session is a develop a new variation of induction, which I will call it technique of mathematical induction.
0:07
I do not insist on the name, but I want you to be aware of the technique and be able to use it.
0:16
So as human function, if the finds here so that if one.
0:24
If one is a half and. And these two one over and 10 plus one plus if or when minus one.
0:37
So we have got the recursive function. And here is the specification of the function.
0:46
It says for all numbers, good at eight one one four ease is divided by N plus one.
0:50
So if we wanted to apply the mathematical induction principle, we would have a problem.
1:00
Namely, there are two problems. One is that the conclusion?
1:08
In the principal, as we have seen it so far and in the assertion that we want to prove has got a different shape, namely in here.
1:14
We are talking about all the natural numbers starting at zero, whereas in here we are talking about the numbers starting from one.
1:26
Moreover, for that mathematical induction principle, as we have seen it so far, the first conjunct talks about the property holding four zero.
1:36
So we would want to say something about the F of zero equals zero divided by one, but F zero is not defined.
1:49
So what can we do? Again, there are three possible solutions.
2:01
And here's your opportunity to think about them. And we will discuss whether you have had some time to lose.
2:11
I hope you would have had some time and you have sort of some approaches in the first approach.
2:21
What we do is we apply the mathematical induction principle, but we changed the shape of the assertion.
2:27
So our Pierro then. Would have the shape that the Ifan is great.
2:35
Well, go on then, something about the F event and if not, we don't care.
2:41
So by changing the shape of the assertion that we want to prove we are back in the
2:47
format that we knew before and we can apply the mathematical induction principle.
2:52
We can also change the assertion slightly differently. Rather than require that any great equal then one, we can add one to all occurrences of N.
3:00
And now again, we have got something that has got the right chape. Both of these approaches work.
3:15
But what we are looking for is a new,
3:23
slightly different principle at different playing principles that allows us rather than to start our discussion at zero,
3:28
to start it a little bit later. In the particular case, start at that end.
3:36
So here is our technique. And it does exactly what we said earlier.
3:44
We wanted to start the the argument not at zero, but some some arbitrary number.
3:50
And this number cannot be positive or negative. So we choose a number and out of the integers, a property that talks about the integers.
3:56
And then we say if the property holds for this an and for all numbers that are greater equal.
4:08
And if it holds for that number, then it holds for the next one, then it holds for all the numbers that are greater, equally within.
4:15
Oh, we're going to apply this technique to the assertion that we wanted to prove earlier on.
4:30
And to do so, I remind you what the technique says, and I invite you to have a go your sentence.
4:38
So here we will be applying that technique to the particular assertion, the bill of N is.
4:49
The property of the function, and we have to first determine what is the ATM?
4:58
Where do we start? At. We start at 1:00.
5:04
Therefore, what we need to know in the first conjunct is that if one is one divided by one plus one and for the second conjunct,
5:11
we need to know that for all K greater than one. This is a one f f K equals K divided by K plus one, then F of K plus one is K plus one the way.
5:23
Right. The Okay. Plus one. Plus one.
5:42
And if those two conjunct hold, then we know that for all and greater than one F of N equals and divided by N plus one.
5:45
And here it is, written out nicely and available in the note, in the footnotes.
6:04
Which will you will be receiving on Tuesday. If there are any questions, please communicate.
6:11
Next, we will be proving the assertion and again, we split the proof into a base case and then inductive step.
6:20
And again, I remind you of the principally that we derived earlier on.
6:28
And what I will be asking you to think is how does this fit into the base case and how does this fit in to the inductive step?
6:36
For the base case, we just required to prove exactly what was in the first conjunct for the inductive step.
6:51
We have to do what we have been doing earlier. We want to prove something for Olcay greater than one.
7:00
So for this, we need to take Kay out of the integers, which is arbitrary and which is great.
7:08
Equals that one. Once we have done this.
7:16
The inductive hypothesis, we assume what was on the left hand side of the application and even then afterwards,
7:20
we need to show what is wrong with the right hand side of the application. If there are any questions, please communicate.
7:30
Let us not look up support. And after you have finished thinking about it, here is how I would go about the proof.
7:40
We want to prove that for one is equal with one divided by one plus one.
7:52
And we have not yet proven it, but we know that the F of one is one of two.
8:01
And this is by the definition of the function f I do not have it upon that.
8:08
It is in it in your notes. So please, compassion and two is equal with that one plus one.
8:14
So we can even say this is because one plus one equals two.
8:22
And now we have that. So the base case is that and we want to move to the inductive step.
8:27
So here is the base case in all its beauty, nicely written up.
8:36
It will be in your slides. Now we do the inductive step and then the inductive step, as we said earlier, we take an arbitrary key.
8:40
We assume that the case greater than one in the convective hypothesis.
8:51
We assume that the property holds for key.
8:55
And we want to show that if pomes for K plus one. And please try to prove.
8:59
So I will not go through the proof for the impact of Steck.
9:09
I stopped again with what I am hoping to show that the F of K plus one equals K plus one divided by keeping us two.
9:15
But I will record that I have not yet proven it.
9:24
So now I would like to start by applying the function definition for if.
9:30
And the function definition says, for one, it has got a certain value and for and it has got another value.
9:39
So which case. Am I at? I might add the value of case of.
9:50
What is the value of keeping us one? Is it one in which case?
9:59
If, if, if, if Cape plus one is one, then F of Cape plus one would be equal with one.
10:03
And if Cape last one is not one, then F of Cape plus one, it would be this more complex term which also calls F of cape.
10:12
And here is where the assumption will come handy, because the assumption, Lynn says, that the key is great, equal then one.
10:30
And therefore, I know that this cannot hold. And therefore, I know that this is the definition of if that should apply.
10:39
So by the assumption I know that the second line of the definition of F applies and therefore F of Cape last one is.
10:53
Is one divided by Capela Swan.
11:06
Dimes K plus one, plus one. Plus F k.
11:14
Still, that holds by definition of if.
11:22
And the assumption and the assumption is very, very important here.
11:26
Once I have reached that, I am here, I will be able to apply the inductive hypothesis.
11:32
So F, K plus one is going to be the term, as we had earlier, plus.
11:39
Gay. Divided by eight plus one. So we apply the inductive hypothesis.
11:45
On this term and would replace f gay by gay overcame plus one.
11:53
So this step I was allowed to do by inductive hypothesis, and then I will do many,
12:05
many more steps which are going to be really symmetric steps, and hopefully that will lead to the terms that I want to have.
12:10
I'm not going to write it up here. I'm not that good at writing on the iPod, but we will be looking at the proof from the next slide.
12:20
So here is the proof.
12:29
We want to show that if KP Batswana is keeping a one divided by keeping us still, so we stopped with F, K plus one here, we apply the definition of F.
12:31
And as I said earlier, we apply the second line.
12:43
We are allowed to do that because of the assumption one.
12:47
And then we apply the inductive hypothesis. And where do you place F, K by K plus one?
12:52
Then we apply several large symmetric steps. And we will get two K plus one divided by Gabler's to.
13:01
I don't want to go through the steps, if you're interested, cheque, then if you're right.
13:10
You need to do the steps, of course. If there are any questions, please ask me.
13:16
So here you can see the principly and the technique and the differences are that in the principle we stop at zero.
13:26
Whereas with the technique we stop at southern no end here.
13:34
When we do the step, we take any naturally number.
13:39
But here we take any integer that is created equal.
13:44
And then the conclusion, our assertion holds for all natural numbers.
13:49
And even that they make it holds for all integers. Greater equal in.
13:54
And if we compare the principle and the technique at the principly, which start at zero, the technique, we stopped at any number.
14:01
And so it is as if we have kind of shifted the technique to start earlier or to start later.
14:13
Now the principle. So then the question arises, what is the difference between the two?
14:20
Is there any difference? What is the difference between the two?
14:30
Is it so that if I have the principle, I can prove the technique?
14:31
Is it so that that if I have the technique, I can prove the principle?
14:36
Is it so that there are some properties that can be proven with a principle, but not with a technique or the other way around?
14:41
This is a matter that I would like to discuss with you. On Tuesday.
