There we go. OK. You it's opening funny. Let's hope everyone is joining.
0:08
Now, let me just click on mine so I can ask everyone to check back.
0:34
OK, so you did not have any real questions that you run through us, really?
0:58
It seems that you were all of you able to solve the problem so far on your own, which is good news.
1:13
This means that you are going to nail coursework because it's pretty much the same type of thing.
1:20
So let's run now, if you have any questions after the tutorial, I see there's one.
1:27
Race and let me check. Yeah, so, yeah, go ahead.
1:33
So for question five with the came up, it says, what's the expression from the came up?
1:38
And then it says, draw the circle of it. However, you can also simplify the came up to make it so there's less logic statements in the circuit.
1:45
Mm hmm. So what would you do in this case.
1:55
So would you still draw the circuit of the expression we obtained from the came up or would we do it of the even more simplified version?
1:57
OK. Yeah. Thanks for asking this. So usually. This is something that has been a bit of a confusion in previous times, so if the exercises test,
2:05
do that call come up and transform it into a circuit, don't do anything further.
2:21
You will see that the answer document, which I think should be available to you in like to five minutes.
2:25
It has been preschedule to go out. So you have four to five more minutes to finish the dessert if you want.
2:31
Usually, if it's like get Cardno from a circuit, that means no further simplification,
2:39
usually when further simplification is needed, it's going to be asked for explicitly.
2:47
But you will see and the answer is that it provides both provides that direct translation and then a very simple simplification just for kicks,
2:54
in case you thought about it, because this is a tutorial, it's more about all the various things you might have looked at.
3:02
But for graded exercises, it will be explicit whether you have to go further or not.
3:08
Thank you. And it was annoying.
3:18
Yeah, go ahead. You mean you mean for moment when you say funny, you mean after doing the those application?
3:23
Yes, exactly. So it happens that some of you are very eager to to get the best possible circuit and even do the exercise.
3:30
And this has happened in previous exams.
3:39
Even though the exercises get the kernel and a circuit and no more simplifications, some of you will get the kernel,
3:42
then some simplify the [INAUDIBLE] out of that expression and then draw the circuit.
3:50
So. Sometimes I will not even see the circuit I was asking for.
3:57
I mean, I can see in some cases that you did the correct thing, but if there's an error, I wouldn't be able to see where the error was.
4:02
Was it in your understanding of the occurrence of the second translation, or is it that there was an error in the simplification?
4:10
So please read the instructions very carefully when it comes to exams and coursework,
4:16
because we are expecting to see specific steps to make sure that you know and understand the whole process.
4:21
So, again, just to underline what I said before. Don, do additional simplifications, unless there's an explicit request to do so.
4:30
Of course, you can do whatever you want on your own.
4:41
Just know that that's not what we are asking for. OK, I see there's no other hands, anybody has some other question regarding lectures or tutorial.
4:45
Yeah, go ahead then you. I'm just wondering with problem one, for instance, in the tutorial,
5:06
if it isn't if we're not explicitly asked to simplify a brilliant equation in some sort of way,
5:14
I'll just looking at it and I see that they've done it by actually supplying the equation itself.
5:21
Could we like instead make a comment and then create and then go back to booting a good equation from that?
5:24
Would that be a valid way in solving that problem? OK, OK, I didn't think of that the way around it.
5:32
But usually what you will see when you look at previous examples is that when we ask you to simplify what
5:42
an equation we are also asking you to name the steps that you are using for each of the simplification.
5:49
So we are checking to see that, you know, how to apply to the rules of simplification.
5:54
So it sure a kernel will give you like a whole lot of simplification and a single step, but that's not applying the rules that we are looking for.
6:00
So in this specific case of problem one, I should change the the problem description so that it's closer to what it's in exams,
6:08
which is simplified using the simplification of rules we know and in each step.
6:18
Tell us what simplification rule you are using. So in this case, if you use the car, normal people would be like, yeah, I simplified, but.
6:23
I. I want to know if you knew how to use those rules, if you know the rules are not great.
6:33
Thank you, sir. I, uh, yeah, uh, Hengshui.
6:40
I don't have my hands up, so I'm not sure. Oh, OK, the bird up in my hand, I don't know why.
6:53
OK. OK, so I see that now.
6:58
OK, you have a I have a question.
7:02
No, I was just wondering when you say that we need to write down the names, the rules that we're using.
7:07
So does that mean we know like all the names of the rules are coming just up implicitly,
7:14
like memorise them and how to use them and to know what they're called?
7:18
You write down the rule itself, like, for example, one and variable term equals the term, things like that or zero and the term equals zero.
7:21
So we don't need to write in 10 percent or the Morgens theorem you can use either.
7:36
To be honest, I, I mean,
7:41
knowing the names is useful when you talk to people because that's like a shorthand that we can
7:45
throw at each other and know what we're talking about rather than writing down the whole thing.
7:51
But the whole point here is to show that you know how to solve problems.
7:55
And in this case, I care a bit less whether you know the name or just the rule itself.
8:02
OK, thank you. Also, you will see that some of them, we always refer to them by name, like the Morgens Theorem,
8:07
others he even on Slide's a.m. and on tutorial answers, you will see that it's like, oh, yes, zero and a equals eight.
8:15
Thank you. Uh, right.
8:28
You know, I just had a follow up to the question in problem one or two, I ended up using the Khanum up, but as you just said,
8:34
that's not the right way to go to go with them because I couldn't figure out what the technique is then.
8:43
So we have to use the mortgage line and all the other subs, some log in here instead of using the cornerman.
8:50
Yes. So, I mean, we could look at the answer right now,
8:56
but I think it's sort of to go back to your slides and the notes and and go through
9:02
all the various rules that we've talked about and see how you can apply them,
9:10
give it. Since the answers are going to go out in like half an hour after we finish the class,
9:13
you will have plenty of time to look at those that were used to solve this tutorial.
9:19
And in the meantime, you have some time if you want to try it out on your own.
9:24
So languid C and C plus C complement.
9:30
Is that also like a rule? Is that that's which one did you say like so that we can replace one with a plus a complement.
9:34
Is that that the method. Is that also ruler. Yes. OK, yes.
9:44
It's on all these various ones that we went through on this item on the notes,
9:49
not all of them have proper names or some of them, even if they have proper names, we just write down the actual.
9:55
All right, I think there was another yeah, Humza,
10:07
you have a guy and this is kind of similar to the previous questions as well, I guess, but so I buy inspection.
10:11
Is that not like a valid step to take? What do you mean by inspection?
10:20
So like I was saying with like the question that everyone is talking about things like one thing I didn't like,
10:26
add anything to the expression I just like considered when like a certain variable was one and zero and then what it did to the entire expression.
10:33
And then I just like wrote down the simple fact I didn't like use any law.
10:43
I just like to look at it kind of like basically by section, because that's what I have to do something else.
10:47
But your inspection is based on some set of rules.
10:52
Right. And you know what you're going through? You are going through them when you remind all of them very quickly.
10:57
So you should be able to tease them apart step by step because your mind at the end of the day, you are doing all of those steps.
11:04
It's just that you are doing them very quickly and it's like, oh, sure, that's the answer.
11:10
But is valid or I actually do have to add steps to the steps and you will see if you look at previous examples,
11:17
it's to simplify this, go step by step and tell me on each step what you're doing.
11:25
So it doesn't get more expensive than that. So.
11:32
Let me see, is there, Shinjo, you have a question?
11:42
Yes, so if for something like the problem, five on size and we actually have we are asked to fill a really large,
11:46
large table with like us one to us five, but for the expectation we already know some of them for the correct answer.
12:00
How far do we still need to fill out? Oh, I just want to ask five staff in that case.
12:09
OK. We're talking about the truth table in problem five.
12:16
Yes. It's really larger. So you will see that in the answer.
12:20
It's dealing exactly with this question.
12:24
The in the answer you will see at this table, there is only partially fields and the rest is is just following these big rules that.
12:27
So I think you are thinking about this when when the process is a equals one, for example, then I will always be zero these days.
12:35
Sure. You don't need to calculate this one is two or three years. It is five.
12:45
You just know what's a you know what's going to happen with our then and that's it.
12:49
And there's only a few of the rules really need to be calculated.
12:56
The rest of you just know them because they are given to you. That is fine.
13:00
That is fine, because at the end of the day, what we care about is the input values A, B and C that like the specific combination of them.
13:04
And when the result is one or zero, that's what we care about,
13:13
because then we are going to construct circuits from the other expressions and simplify them and circuits and
13:17
so forth to the intermediate points are for you to make it easier to keep track of things that make sense.
13:22
Thank you. Sure. First, assuming that maybe someday I think that an exam to make it simpler, I ask you for a specific intermediate point,
13:31
but then it will be explicit, like give me these intermediate point, the truth of it.
13:44
But otherwise, intermediate points are just for for just to be helpful to you.
13:50
So we have time for one more question if you have it. And if not, we are going to call it any item.
13:57
See, so. Now is the time, otherwise we will have to leave it either for them.
14:02
I see that you don't have a lot of questions to ask them.
14:11
And also not very many questions through tutorials, if it's because everything's clear and there really is no doubt that that's great,
14:16
but if you have doubts, please raise them up like you don't need to wait for our life sessions.
14:24
Of course, you're more than welcome to ask them during life. This is what I'm saying, is that I have a question.
14:32
Yeah, go ahead. So I think, one, if it's true, a question was that is kind of proof that the Maxtor and mentor is derived came out all the same.
14:38
So how would you go about to prove it? Well, it's similar to the simplification problems, right?
14:49
You have a series of rules and you can play with them. You can play with them so that you go from one representation to the other.
14:56
If you can do that on each and on each step, you apply rules that are correct and you apply them correctly.
15:03
You just prove their equivalence. Does it make sense?
15:09
So basically, right, so right of indigenous people, they are exactly opposite of each other on the truce table for that relation.
15:14
Type of minters on Moxon's. Yes, exactly the opposite.
15:27
Yes, but when. But the expression that you get.
15:32
So we are constructive. So we are constructing them either by taking all the zero results or all the one results, and then it's going to be maximum.
15:37
But the result is always expressing the output.
15:46
It just different ways of making canonical expression possible.
15:51
So the output so but it's always the same thing. Psychologists say like since they have exactly the opposite results or for inputs and outputs,
15:56
they are equal or like these two expressions are the same kinds of sellards.
16:09
So imagine that I'm giving you.
16:16
That you calculate that can only come into the form of a table and I'm giving you something that looks like a canonical maximum form,
16:20
but it's not clear if it's the same or not, you can always do these steps by induction, basically proof whether they are or are not the same.
16:29
So that's what I'm that's what I was trying to ask for in this tutorial, again,
16:44
you could write it down on a truth table and see if they are one and the other.
16:51
If if if the question has space for doing it this way, that is technically correct.
17:00
Usually tutorials are a bit loose, but usually in coursework and in exams.
17:07
The questions are a lot more focussed. And it's unlikely that there is going to be this leeway on choosing multiple
17:13
ways to do things that are still going to be some leeway in how you do things.
17:22
But it's going to be a lot clearer whether you can just use the that thing with it or explicitly asking you to show me the steps.
17:26
And so if we were to use to say, well, let's say that's the case, do we need to write specific things to show that leads to expressions or the same?
17:35
Honestly, I'm not sure how you would show me with a truth table what it is that you would show me in this case,
17:45
like you have got my mentors and the results of the of my services on both sides of this table are exactly the opposite.
17:52
Mm hmm. So then you would have to fill in the whole truth table.
18:01
Show me that expression in problem three is four of them in terms is exactly the mean terms, which is I think that's what it's talking about.
18:05
Right. Yes. And show me that the expression given in problem four is exactly the mike therms of that same truth table.
18:16
And therefore they are expressing the same circuit.
18:24
By definition, yeah. OK, thank you.
18:29
OK, so now we really got to go because it's half past and that's the time when we said so you're going to have time to do all your classes and things.
18:35
So thanks very much. I'm going to upload these videos like the first and second half right now.
18:50
And because you want to go through them and again, feel free to use them to ask us questions any time now.
18:57
Take care. Have a great weekend and goodbye.
19:06
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
19:11
Bye. Thank you.
