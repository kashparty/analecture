Title: Ethics 6
Category: Ethics
Lecturer: Thomas Lancaster
Date: 15/12/2021
So hi there, everyone, welcome to this bonus lecture with Blé,
0:02
where he's going to look at some of the decision frameworks to help you to determine what to do in an ethical situation.
0:07
Sublime. Take it away. What I'm going to try and do is pull the slides off the virtual background I want.
0:16
I'm going to start again then and not make this into a proper recording.
0:26
Apart from that would involve editing, which I which is a pain.
0:30
So we will just continue. But I may add this.
0:34
I can cut this down on Panopto afterwards, and right. Because that way, you can see me on the slides.
0:39
Okay, well, I hope you can just see me on the slides.
0:56
So this lectures help from sources to help with your presentation.
1:01
Please note, I'm only making suggestions here and feel free to impress me with your presentations to do something innovative.
1:10
There's no rules against innovating, but here's some suggestions.
1:19
So if I were talking about the Sony hack and Sony was hacked, it was for quite a while ago now.
1:25
So they won't have taken your particular personal details, but they were hacked.
1:34
The first thing you would discuss is as far as we can tell, and that I publicised that for a reason.
1:41
All we've been saying about not all sources are equal and so on, and you must treat some sources with a certain degree of scepticism.
1:49
But as far as we can tell, what happens as part of the presentation,
1:58
what happened and try and distinguish guesswork media spin from more reliable information.
2:01
The second question you need to ask is, what could you have done differently?
2:10
And one thing I have to say quite loudly here is in that case, don't forget the obvious.
2:15
If someone hacks into your system, that's bad.
2:22
But don't forget the professionals are all paid to provide security.
2:26
So you can't you can't always blame the hackers. Modern systems are constantly under attack, so much so that some security experts,
2:32
particularly with a big thing like online gaming systems like Sony were running, say it's almost impossible to prevent hacks.
2:44
And a further twist is nowadays they talk about state actors.
2:54
They very rarely name the states.
2:59
But the implication I get from my colleagues in security is that certain states are heavily and actively involved in trying to hack online systems.
3:01
It's not, you know, it's part of the web that now for I.T. professionals.
3:13
So it's, you know, it's no longer the occasional event.
3:19
It's in fact you could you could ask you could simply ask if imperial or ask around.
3:24
And I'm sure Imperial will say they are constantly under attack if they've told me this,
3:29
including by other countries trying to get a particularly vaccine information.
3:37
But so yes, it's almost it's almost like the weather hacking now.
3:44
But don't forget that, you know, if you if you're running a system or even just a little website, security is something that it's your job to do.
3:50
Now, ethics also involves presenting your case, and in this case,
4:02
I think there's a good argument to say that Sony could have presented things differently, differently.
4:07
I'd also like to point out that what Sony did not revealing the full extent of the hack for a month is now illegal.
4:13
The law has changed, and you need to know about particular about what's commonly referred to as GDPR,
4:22
although technically it's the Data Protection Act 2018. But you need to know what the law says because again, it could just be part of your work.
4:29
And the third thing that you could discuss usefully on?
4:42
Remember, these are just suggestions. The third thing you could discuss is could it happen again?
4:47
To what extent is the problem fixed? And I've also made some hints about that.
4:52
It's also important for me to say that what would you have done? It's an interesting thing to discuss.
4:58
I mean, and I do hope you have a lot of discussion in your group about this, but it doesn't need to be vague and open ended.
5:03
Those structural approaches, one of which is the unethical leaders decision tree from a 2002 Harvard Business Review,
5:10
and I think I've put links up to that before. I wouldn't just cut and paste that decision.
5:21
Tree. Make your own decision tree and maybe make some tweaks to it.
5:27
Which, of course, will prove to me that you've thought about this one.
5:33
But the real use of a decision tree is for you to realise that there were decisions made.
5:37
There are decision points, things could do differently. And now we're structuring what you could do differently.
5:43
You could flowchart it.
5:50
No objections to boxes of arrows or even the gunshot or whatever saying this is what this is, what Sony did and this is what we would do.
5:51
Notice the differences. That's quite a structured way of answering the question What would you have done differently?
6:03
Books have also put up a framework for taking decisions, ethical decisions in cases like this.
6:12
I have to say, you know, even though Penny do Kunai, whose name is on the reference,
6:21
there is a student of mine and someone I really respect a lot in this area.
6:27
But the diode framework is probably not going to be helpful for you.
6:37
It's difficult to use. It's quite complex. Worth looking at, but I certainly wouldn't insist that you use it.
6:42
But at least I've told you about it, and that is all I've got to say in my suggestions.
6:52
So perhaps Thomas could stop the recording at that point unless you've got questions.
6:59
I'm trying to think, well, just just to sum up in any of many students in attendance, if you got any questions, feel free to to let us know.
7:08
But I think in terms of just completing your assignment, the take takeaway message in all these frameworks out there,
7:17
these are not the only ones, and you may find more of an AI type framework is appropriate to think about in some circumstances as well.
7:24
And also, if you were to look at the details of those frameworks and those processes,
7:32
then they talk about things like shareholders and maximising shareholder value.
7:37
But you might also think about maximising stakeholder value as it is an idea we talked about before as well, which I think is really relevant.
7:42
But as Blake says, these are just ideas about structured approaches because a structured approach is useful.
7:50
But is these are not the only ways of doing things and you can come up with with other ideas as well.
7:56
So at that point, I think we'll say thanks everyone just for checking out this short video about completing ethics assignment.
