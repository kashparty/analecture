So now I want to introduce weighted graphs, many networks have a cost associated with each arc in their transport network,
0:02
that cost could be the distance, the time to be taken for that journey or the amount of fuel or the cost of the fuel.
0:11
And we'll call these costs weights. So on this graph on the left, the arcs have got a weight in the blue associated with them.
0:21
And we'll define a weighted graph, which is a graph paired with weighting.
0:33
Function is a simple graph g together with weight function W, which is a map from the arcs of G to the real's growth and or equal to zero.
0:38
Obviously, well, we tend not to want negative costs because normally getting from one place to another does not gain us money.
0:51
It costs us money. Basically. We shall investigate three well-known classical problems, finding a minimum spanning tree.
1:02
We'll look at Prem's algorithm and Chris Gall's algorithm finding shortest path.
1:13
So we'll look at Dijkstra's algorithm and the Floyd Warshel algorithm.
1:18
And finding a short its shorter circuit. The famous travelling salesman problem.
1:23
So we're trying to minimise cost, and so it is sensible to restrict ourselves to simple graphs.
1:30
Why is that? If there are two parallel arcs, then two alternative routes to choose, then we will always choose the cheaper one.
1:37
So we might as well get rid of the more expensive arc because we are never going to want to choose it.
1:45
And similarly, if there's a loop, then going around the loop is just going to cost us.
1:50
And so we are never going to actually want to use that loop. So we might as well be eliminated from the graph as well.
1:55
So when we restrict a simple grass, then an art can be specified uniquely by giving its end point.
2:01
So we can just write. OK, says pairs of their end points.
2:07
And we can regard the weight function then as acting on pairs of nodes.
2:13
And so we can write W of one to which, of course, since we're dealing with undirected graphs here, will be the same as W of two one.
2:18
So remember that every connected graph has a spanning tree, we saw how to show that.
2:29
And spanning tree connects all the nodes in the graph with the least number of arcs.
2:34
And obviously will be a sub graph of the original graph. Now, when dealing with weighted graphs,
2:40
we want to find a minimum spending tree that is spent spanning tree where the sum of the weights of its ox is as small as possible.
2:47
For instance, if you want to build a road network joining some cities,
2:55
a minimum spending tree would represent the cheapest or shortest or lowest cost network, which would connect all the cities.
3:00
So we might decide we're not going to maintain all the roads. Let's just find some subset and maintain those.
3:09
So let's have a look at an example. So here's a graph from the top left with a weighted graph.
3:18
And on the top right, we have a spanning tree.
3:26
Now, obviously, any spanning tree, because we have four nose here should have three arcs.
3:30
So that's a spanning tree. But what is the weight of that spending tree?
3:36
Well, we add up the weights at the ox and we see that that is weight twelve.
3:41
But that's not a minimum spanning tree for the graph because we can actually do better.
3:46
We don't really want to choose the five here because that's the most expensive grow.
3:51
OK, so let's see if we can avoid using the five. So here on the bottom left is a spanning tree with a cost of nine.
3:55
And in fact, that's the minimum as it's not hard to see because we've got to use three arcs.
4:07
So if we choose the three shortest, then we obviously confuse the two and the three.
4:13
And then we've got a choice of one for or the other four. And in fact, the other four works as well.
4:18
So here we've got another minimum spending tree for this original graph, which shows us that MSDS need not be unique.
4:24
So these both have weight 9D. And as I say, we've we've seen that that is minimum here.
4:35
So let's define moments, spending trees. Let Chibi awaited graph.
4:45
And the weight of a spanning tree. T 4G is the sum of the weights of the arcs of that tree.
4:50
And we'll say the T is a minimum spanning tree or MSD for short for G.
4:58
If T is a spanning tree for G and no other spanning tree for tree has smaller weight.
5:03
So we phrase that carefully so that we will allow that there could be several minimum spanning trees.
5:09
But of course they all have the same minimum weight.
