Title: Ethics Assignment Introduction - 13 December 2021
Category: Ethics
Lecturer: Thomas Lancaster
Date: 13/12/2021
Right, sir. Hi, everyone, I am, I'm Thomas, we've got Billy with us here to talk to you about ethics and professional issues,
0:03
which is what you are studying this week. So hopefully for most of you now you're at the end of term.
0:13
So the only thing you have to concentrate on is working on an assignment for a few days, hopefully investigating an interesting ethical topic.
0:20
I know that James, these students have still got the odd tutorial left this week,
0:30
but that will fit in quite nicely around everything else you've been doing.
0:34
So in advance of today's session, we have put some short videos up which are on Panopto,
0:40
which are linked off slang to hopefully being able to have a glance through them or look at the slides.
0:46
It's not too crucial if you haven't, because you should be able to cope, but it just gives you some ideas about things that were useful for you.
0:52
So this week, also elsewhere in your course as well for that.
0:59
So I've sort of spoken to most of you before through videos, not in person with a topic like this.
1:07
I will get more involved in your course, particularly in later years with things like projects as you go through.
1:14
But I am a teaching fellow in the department there in computing.
1:20
Lee is with us as a guest lecturer who supports us with ethics every year.
1:30
One of the UK, as would you say, premier ethicists.
1:36
A word I suppose I've been publishing in the field of computing that effects for longer than pretty much anybody.
1:39
I don't know about outstanding. I've certainly been around.
1:51
Well, I mean, to me, if there's something about ethics and blade is that no, it is not worth knowing because.
1:58
Yeah, exactly, especially in the field. Yeah, exactly.
2:05
And of course, you're a government adviser as well and you sit on committees there.
2:10
It doesn't guarantee, like anything else, the government actually listens to you, but you do have that that role to support things there.
2:16
So this is a really great opportunity to pick Blaz Brain as well as we go through the week here.
2:24
But we have ethics on your course because it is useful because it is required by the accrediting bodies, by the BCS and others as part of your course,
2:32
because the kind of thing you may well be asked about nowadays when you go for a job
2:42
interview and we want you to think about computing situations for the wider world.
2:45
And that's really what we're set up for you over the next four and a bit days.
2:51
So what's going to happen is we're going to look at the assignment details for you, which split into two parts.
2:56
One part is working on a group is a group on an ethical topic.
3:03
We have a list, I think, about 80 topics we prepared for you to choose between,
3:08
but it would be a maximum of one group topic and you're going to be handing it a video at the end of the week.
3:12
And also, at the end of the week,
3:19
you're going to be handing in individually just a short one page written summary of the ethical topic you've been investigating.
3:21
Now, in terms of writing, we have writing in here because you don't get to do much writing in your course, which is a bit of a shame.
3:29
But you do have big bits of writing to do later on, such as a final year project, and this is that help you.
3:36
And what we have is we have the Centre for Academic English, which is a separate part of Imperial,
3:43
who are going to be running a session with you tomorrow afternoon to help you with writing.
3:48
And at some point this afternoon,
3:53
you should get a message from the Centre for Academic English from Brit Harmony about the blackboard site they've set up for you to look at.
3:56
That is short. They're just asking you to read a couple of things in advance and they will run that session with you tomorrow.
4:08
Yeah, I will join you for that session in the background, as on teams, but there's not that much more to say about that.
4:16
They're going to be doing the teaching with you about academic writing for that, and they're also going to be marking that.
4:26
So we're not going to get involved to get to them as the writing experts respond to and critique your writing.
4:31
This play, and I am most interested in for the purpose of this week is going to be the
4:39
ethics side of things and helping you to choose an interesting topic to work on.
4:44
So. But I think it's important. Yes, in a word, but it's absolutely vital.
4:49
It's a it's a difficult subject to maybe get some enthusiasm for because it's one of grey areas, debateable points, no definite answers.
5:00
But in the end, you have to take decisions. I think coming out, which is slightly different, why?
5:11
Why is it that I like to come at it this way? The whole point of the ethics and the professionalism is not to please.
5:18
Imperial is not to please the basics.
5:27
It's to please employers and what you possibly don't realise that your stage in your career is that out there in the world of computing you,
5:30
you will have to work in a multidisciplinary team. You'll have to work in small teams, usually, but four or five people.
5:41
And of course, employers are constantly saying to BCS to imperial, don't send us graduates who don't know about ethics.
5:48
They're no use to us in the real world.
5:56
So if this is an important part of your professional development and I hope you realise it's not something that,
5:59
but Thomas and I have just decided it is good for you. It's something that employers are demanding of graduates.
6:07
Yes, explained.
6:17
And we've put together this assignment designing it to at least be interesting for you to hopefully be fun because of that many opportunities.
6:19
When you get to work on videos or anything like that on your course there.
6:28
And to give you the choice of some quite interesting ethics topics to to get your teeth into,
6:33
but also to use the research skills that you've been developing as well.
6:39
So ethics could be an incredibly dry subject, and we're trying to avoid that.
6:44
But as Blake says, unfortunately, we're all computer scientists here, but it's not one of the subjects where which are right or wrong,
6:50
or you have one single approach and one single correct answer there.
6:58
And and that can be a bit tricky if you're not used to. That way of thinking is also worth 10 percent of your marks for computing practical one,
7:03
and it is a pretty pure practical one is your biggest module in the first year anyway,
7:10
and it can be the difference if your programming is not brilliant between you.
7:16
Between the you getting a good mark and a not so good mark about the classification you get for it.
7:21
Remembering your past smart, slow computer Practical one is 50 of the most modules.
7:27
It's only 40, so you can use this as an opportunity to push Mark-Up.
7:32
And yeah, I think it's worth thinking about as well.
7:35
So you can feel free to type in questions and we'll go through them.
7:42
I think we will perhaps start off by looking at the assignment and seeing what's involved and just going through this.
7:47
I will put this up on my screen. So you can see it, you can access this as well.
7:56
Directly on Kate. So if it's not visible, let me know, but I believe this should all be visible, but that will not.
8:08
And yeah, so the question in the chat, yeah, we are going through this now. So don't worry if not missed anything,
8:18
but I'm just trying to monitor the various windows at the same time and make sure that everybody
8:23
watching in the waiting room who's arriving as we're speaking is allowed into the room.
8:28
And obviously, the question do employers care about ethics since most software engineers are not part of the business?
8:36
I mean, that is a very interesting question. I'm talking about word.
8:43
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
8:47
we mean most UK universities care about being part of the courses being accredited by the
8:51
BCS because it is a big selling point to attract students to go on the course there.
8:59
So it's a difficult one. But yeah, you'll get different views.
9:08
You will certainly get companies who don't act ethically, and that may be something you pick up on when you choose these topics.
9:10
Well, that. I'm talking announcer here.
9:17
All right, I'll let you type the answer.
9:21
Let me let me zoom in, so you should be able access this assignment from Kate where you've got my email address,
9:22
Blaz email address by Harmony's email address as well, if you need us. But there is also an editor.
9:30
The standard editor board computing practica one is great for you to ask questions as well that will get to us,
9:35
and we have two deadlines for Friday at seven p.m. $9800.
9:42
Is that UK time that you'll need to submit your video and the slides on Kate
9:48
and we're asking you to submit individually a one page summary on Blackboard.
9:55
You should if you look at the blackboard, you probably if you're computing, you won't use Blackboard very much.
10:01
If you GMC, you might have used it a bit more for maths.
10:06
But if you log in, you should see the support module for this, which is the centre for academic English side of things.
10:09
And there's just a very simple link to uploads that one Page two on Friday.
10:14
Any problems with upload send the questions to Brett rather than to blame me because we
10:19
don't have direct access to setting up that assignment and making the changes for that one.
10:24
Are you going to be working in a group your group is already chosen for?
10:32
You should have to worry about that, and your group is the people who have the same personal tutor as you and who attend the same party or TMT.
10:37
Is you for that one? So essentially, it's a personal tutor group, but some personal tutors have more than one group.
10:46
So it is only the the people are in the same party and PMT.
10:55
So for most of you, this group of four very occasionally it might be a three or five.
11:00
It's not going to make a major difference for this assignment. But if you're working on a three, then we will give you the benefit,
11:05
the doubt if you haven't accomplished quite as much, but in some ways it's easier to work the three.
11:11
So don't necessarily think of it as a disadvantage.
11:15
You've all probably been involved with groups and teams before in that way, and one of you has been completely randomly chosen as the group leader.
11:18
I say it's random up nicely. Sure has.
11:30
A group leader was chosen because someone else did that, but that just means that person will be the person who does various things on the system.
11:32
Now on the unlikely event that someone in your group has gone a while and they can't do that, you'll have to let me know so we can address that.
11:40
I can see we've got most people in the year with us now, so hopefully you're working and available,
11:48
but there is a small chance somebody might have decided they needed to get out of the
11:54
country on a flight today before the the borders potentially got became unavailable.
11:58
Not that I think that's going to happen. And so not everyone is available now.
12:03
If so, let me know because we we can address that.
12:07
We're expecting you all to be able to operate remotely. So for this week?
12:10
OK. I mean, this is a reminder about plagiarism on the assignment brief.
12:15
Please don't copy your summaries from the web or from one another.
12:20
So what are you doing, you're working in a group, you're going to choose the ethical topic from a selection of topics,
12:29
and you're going to create an engaging video presentation about how ethics is relevant to the topic.
12:36
Drawing on appropriate research sources so we wouldn't need to relate it to computing and relate it to your course.
12:43
And we're most interested in you looking at the computing aspects of this because you're on computing courses,
12:50
but there may be maybe some business aspects or the things. In many cases, the company does something not ethical.
12:56
It could be because of a business consideration or a financial consideration,
13:02
but do make sure you include some computing content because we just need to have
13:06
that to verify that you have an interest in our understanding of computer ethics,
13:10
and you can review the resources that are provided for you, which would cover us the things you need to know.
13:16
Some of you may have found some additional material on ethics, which is relevant as well.
13:23
That's absolutely fine. You're more than welcome to read outside this.
13:27
You've not got that many days to work on things for that part,
13:30
and I will show you the The Project Portal, which is this link project portal dot dot dot.
13:36
I see the Duke, which is where the group leader can choose your preferred ethical topics as well.
13:42
So you have 10 marks available. Five marks are going to be field.
13:49
VIDEO five marks are going to be if you're individual summary, which is marked by the Centre for Academic English,
13:53
they will go through the details of the summary for you tomorrow, but it is just a maximum one page, a maximum of 300 words.
13:59
We want to see you just writing then in a short format and they've put up on the blackboard site some previous summaries as examples
14:06
and abstracts for you to look at to give you an idea about what this could look like and also for you to critique for that.
14:15
There's also a peer assessment system. This is produced in-house within the department peer assessment.
14:23
Doctor, I see the UK, you should be able to log into it, but you won't see the of peer assessment yet.
14:29
I have uploaded it, but I haven't put it live yet because you haven't worked in the group yet,
14:38
so it's a bit pointless you filling it in until you have.
14:42
But you should know the other people in your group because they attend sessions with you, so you have a bit of a head start for doing that.
14:46
And by Friday, by the same deadline, you just got to be asked to give a mark between one and five for the other group members,
14:53
of which three means expect a standard.
15:00
So if there are no problems, that's fine. You just fill it in any other problems, then put some comments.
15:04
So we know if somebody has been able or somebody hasn't pulled their weight and we can take that into account during the booking process for that one.
15:11
So that's meant to be quite lightweight, but you'll see the system being used for other modules as you go through the course,
15:18
including your group work at the end of the first year when you see programming as well for that one there.
15:24
And the video is a maximum of 15 minutes.
15:32
So please don't go beyond 15 minutes because when he looks through them, we'll just click stop and then we'll get to your conclusions.
15:35
The good thing about editing is you can get around that. Now we don't have much in the way of formal teaching for you.
15:42
You'll be pleased to know because we want you to spend your time getting on with this to working in your groups,
15:51
to reading things that but the links are up on the timetable.
15:56
I think they're up on AD as well, and they're certainly up on in the assignment brief.
16:01
We have a Q&A session tomorrow morning, which is you're welcome to come and ask us questions if there aren't any questions.
16:07
Just here. I talk to each other about things. We have Bret and the Centre Academic English tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. as well.
16:13
And Brett has just mentioned here he had a decent brief is a very short quiz to look at before the session tomorrow doesn't carry any marks.
16:22
And then we have Q and A's as the week goes on, just to help you with these help you go through things for that.
16:31
One of the deadline is Friday at seven p.m. The project portal is a system we use for many of our projects as we go through there.
16:38
We're going to ask you to look at the topics available as a group and to choose
16:50
six preferred topics to rank them from your first choice to your sixth choice.
16:54
And then later today, I will run an algorithm that will hopefully manage to allocate every group to one of their choices.
17:01
Now your computer scientist, you can work out that it is possible that it may not be possible to do that.
17:08
But previous experience the last couple of years is we have managed to get everyone one of the choices by doing that as well.
17:16
You have ups my folder, I should say 7:00 p.m. I will update that,
17:26
that you have these documents to submit before Friday at seven p.m. 9800, which your slides, your video link.
17:31
And we just ask you to put your video online somewhere where Blakey and I and anyone else can access.
17:40
It might include external examiners as well, who sometimes check things to check the marking process.
17:46
And my suggestion is you just put this up on YouTube as an unlisted or private video.
17:53
So the only people who know the link can view it. And on Kate, you just put a text file with that link there.
17:59
Be nice if you could just paste the link indicate, but that doesn't work. You have to put a text file with a link to do that.
18:07
You mean you can make it visible if you want. It doesn't really matter, but we've said to this thing is just to make it unlisted.
18:13
We're not worried about the technology, about how you host things.
18:20
What we don't want is to and you won't be able to is to be given something we have to download.
18:23
We want you to click on things and and watch them because there are 52 groups and quite a lot of things to do, as you can imagine.
18:28
And you've got the peer review that the summary.
18:36
There's also the option if you're happy for us to make the video available for next year's students to look at,
18:38
or possibly even on the eponymous YouTube channel.
18:44
Then I have put a consent form up at the end of this document, and it's also in word format on Santiam that if you are happy,
18:48
then by all means fill it in, but you're not forced to do that by any means.
18:57
That's that's purely optional. We we tried this last year, so you could have some to look at and nobody actually.
19:01
But I didn't make and I didn't do this until after the deadline. And so nobody feels accepted, woman.
19:10
So I hope is this year, at least a few groups be happy to let people next year look at some videos to give them an idea about what's involved.
19:15
Assuming we all do have videos next year, who knows the way the world is, it could be something be different.
19:22
But actually, this video format has worked really well.
19:27
And I must say that just off the record, we were incredibly impressed by the standards the videos last year,
19:30
the highest standards in face-to-face presentations, in my opinion that we're seeing in the videos.
19:37
And I guess that's a positive thing not having to worry about the person in the group to speak for ten minutes out of five.
19:44
And so nobody else can finish the presentation in time for that one.
19:50
And all right, so you got to choose a title for your topic.
19:55
You need to stick to that area. We don't mind if you slightly improved the title for the purpose of the video just to give it a catchy title from age.
20:00
We'd like you to make some slides to support your video in widescreen format and submit those landscape landscape format for that one.
20:08
And we've given you some ideas about things to think about when you're investigating your topic here.
20:19
That just helps somebody who knows a bit about computing, but not necessarily an ethical expert, not necessarily an expert in the topic.
20:24
You've chosen to understand what you're doing.
20:31
But we want to know about ethics and the research you've done that relates to the topic, but all the topics are slightly different.
20:34
So I don't want to say there is. One definitive approach will give you a perfect video in every single circumstance,
20:42
because there really isn't that there's a bit here which mentions we'd like you to try and back up what you say with evidence that.
20:51
So this is academia and academia values, other people's opinions generally more than it values your opinions there.
21:00
So we're looking at what kind of sources you can use highly verifiable.
21:07
Are there? Are there any academic sources you can use to back up what you said?
21:12
It may not be the case in many things you're doing because you're looking at something that's happened in the last six months,
21:16
which has been ethical, more questionable than perhaps nobody has discussed this academically.
21:22
But there might be other types of research that have been done that might be news discussions you can rely on.
21:27
While there might be a related area of ethics which you can rely on, and if you find, for instance, ethical series of features in well.
21:33
He's talked about things in his presentations like decision trees you can use on then
21:42
then that can be useful as well or any frameworks you apply it to for that one.
21:49
So I kind of see something that's on us. Yeah, of course you can. Yeah, please don't let me see Wikipedia as a reference.
21:54
It's personal with me because once just before giving a talk in Abu Dhabi of all places, I look at what you should never do.
22:03
I put me into Google.
22:15
Some friendly troll, probably a student had written some very rude things on my Wikipedia page, so I'm not saying don't use Wikipedia.
22:18
I'm saying realise it is not an academic source because any idiot can write anything on Wikipedia and any idiot does.
22:28
So please go through it to proper references. And also, if you possibly can develop a feel for references in one of the examples I gave,
22:36
which is an example of a commercial piece of I.T. that was that was woefully inadequate and we have had one of those in this year.
22:48
Bear in mind that a lot of the stuff,
22:59
a lot of the stuff in Wired and Computer Weekly is written by competing firms who basically have an agenda of saying,
23:01
if you'd given us the contract, it would all go well.
23:10
So sometimes you have to take these things with a pinch of salt, but that but that's what we mean by being selective amongst references.
23:12
Okay, I'll shut up now. Thanks. Knows I'm fine.
23:20
No. So why were we both here that? Yeah.
23:25
I mean, so the question would just come in the chap, by the way, about groups.
23:29
In case I missed that, you have already been grouped and you are grouped into your personal church group and you should know who the people.
23:33
I have the same personal tutor as you and attend the same sessions as you because you've seen them throughout the year.
23:40
But if you don't.
23:45
Just in case, when I show you the project portal, you'll able to look on there and it will give you the names of the members of your group.
23:46
So that is all up there. So rescue to make a 15 minute video of there is again, not one right way to do videos of video editing,
23:54
but it's a good idea, perhaps to think about who in your group is already good at this.
24:04
There is bound to be at least one person in your group who uses YouTube and does videos for that already, who can help you with this there?
24:11
So a normal thing about the people on TikTok we need to do.
24:22
You can't. It's just 30 seconds to 15 minutes, but it's the same kind of idea for this and just you normal video editing.
24:27
So things like make sure you record the same screen resolution, make sure you balanced the sound.
24:35
We ask you all to appear on the video because we want to see you all, because by seeing you, it helps us build a certain amount of trust.
24:40
But also, if we don't see you, then we've no way verifying who's actually done this video because it could be anyone for that one.
24:47
Apart from that,
24:55
there is no one process that works brilliantly for everything there and keep this available for the rest of the academic year as well.
24:56
Please, just in case we have to show it to the external examiners and.
25:05
We expect everyone to contribute fully in the group is up to you, how you how you work as a group, how you split your time there.
25:11
OK, something that happens every year that we need to be aware of all that if someone in the group only finishes at it,
25:20
but you sing a bit of the video two hours before the deadline.
25:29
That's the chance of you getting that video edited and rendered and uploaded on time is practically zero.
25:32
Because it just takes longer than that. Computers are fairly fast, but there's always things to do.
25:39
So you need to leave that bit of time as well. You also need to leave that time to do your individual summary.
25:45
And a lot of this is about bringing the time management skills in that you've been developing throughout the term,
25:50
and you should be very good if you got to the end of the first term at Imperial.
25:56
So think about when you need the video done by it to make all this pull together for that one.
26:00
There is a marking scheme for the video at the end of the document.
26:07
The marking scheme for the summary is in the materials the centre academic English has done for you.
26:12
But just to note, we've got about a quarter of the marks for you. You're introducing the task and covering in the background and motivation.
26:18
Go by a quarter of the marks for the ethical side of things ethics. A quarter of the marks for the professional side of things.
26:25
And of course, the marks the quality of the video and the presentation. So make sure you cover all of those areas there to go with that.
26:32
And that really is the assignment we might scale that if some of you have not done the work and you told me that when you do the peer review,
26:40
you will be able to see the average mark you've been awarded by other students will be able to see what student gave you,
26:48
what mark or anything like that. So just to give you that as an idea.
26:54
Thomas, can you give me a sample? Do we have videos from last year?
27:00
We haven't, because as I mentioned about the this consent form at the end here, that nobody else can fill that in last year.
27:05
So I've actually integrated it a bit more formally into the assignment this year so you can show them you don't have to do.
27:11
But just to know on Kate that will be a box for you to upload a file.
27:19
If you don't want the consent, you can upload a blank file that is absolutely fine as well.
27:23
But yeah, I will try and get around that one.
27:29
That was, yeah, I mean, last year this year, we didn't think about this until a bit too late for that one, right?
27:31
So where do you see this system here? I can see the question in the chat, which is no surprise, which is about choosing topics.
27:39
So this system here is the project portal, and hopefully you can all log into it.
27:48
I will just paste the link into the chat for you.
27:54
We probably found it. Now what you're seeing is my view is the person is responsible for this, so your view is going to be slightly different.
27:58
So please don't worry. So you got a slightly different view to the one I have here.
28:05
This is the same system we use to manage your final year projects and your group project in a third year and various other systems,
28:11
but you will see a link as a student. There'll be an option for you to see who's in your group and to see who your group leader is on there.
28:21
You'll also be able to see the list of all the available proposals. And these are the proposals.
28:30
The topics we have up for you, and there are 87 of them to choose from.
28:37
There are 52 groups, and what we're going to ask you to do is for the group leader discussing this,
28:42
for everyone else to choose six of these and to rank these from your first choice to your choice.
28:49
And some point later today, which I will agree with you, would you let me know how long you're going to need to do this?
28:59
Then I will close off the selection. I will run an algorithm and the algorithm will try and get every group one of their six choices.
29:06
So that is the process, and chances are we will get one of those six choices.
29:16
There's no guarantee we will get you.
29:20
You're your first choice because if everybody all wants to look at how I was used to finish Beethoven's last symphony,
29:21
which is there is one of the ethical choices for the year, then clearly that maths does not work out.
29:29
So that is the that is the process. I need.
29:36
Any hints play about how to choose these items include. This is all we're giving you to work on is the title,
29:45
so we're just giving you a very high level place to start because we want you to do the research as well.
29:52
I would hope that people discuss with the group and choose one that they're going to enjoy finding out a bit more.
29:57
I mean, it's it's quite a good idea to have some fun doing this rather than working on a topic that doesn't interest you much.
30:05
We we've we've actually tried to produce topics that we think will interest you.
30:14
And yeah, if you want to to bend the subject a bit, I'll be quite tolerant about that.
30:20
Yes, it will say no, sorry plan, but you were putting your policy. We're still talking, so keep going.
30:29
No, that's pretty much all I want to say. Please, please choose something that interests you and do it thoroughly.
30:35
Yeah. And. I will mention that we've deliberately given you a good amount of choice and we've tried to avoid giving you a choice.
30:44
The topics were taken last year, so for any reasons to vary,
30:55
there are obviously some new things because they've only happened this year and
31:00
some of them which look older that we've never suggested before as topics.
31:04
So I'm quite keen to see some of these myself as well.
31:09
But if you were just to think about these, they they don't necessarily all have exactly the same amount of scope in terms of the background research,
31:14
but you is available to support them so it can vary a bit from topic to topic here.
31:22
I think covering a bit about what you're interested in as well, and I say some of them are a little bit closer to the wire than some others.
31:27
So if if you have under 18s in your group,
31:40
I think we only have one or two people who under 18 left and please don't choose anything that is unsuitable,
31:43
but we've made these available because I think that's fair for the other groups for this.
31:51
But I mean, most, most ethical topics do have a.
31:57
They all have a bit of scope, and I mean, it is ethics, they're all about things that could be misused or could be could involve crime.
32:04
All things are hacking or could be considered a bit dodgy in some circumstances.
32:13
That's how these things work. But you can see these and I mean, just out of interest.
32:17
If anybody is happy to share the screen as a student, then we can show you how this looks from the student point of view, then.
32:24
And if you are the group leader, even better.
32:33
But essentially, when you rank these, you're going to have to choose a button which says select to start with,
32:36
which will put these essentially into your shortlist. And once you've selected them, you can rank them from First Choice, the sixth choice.
32:43
You can change those ranks around as much or as little as you want as well for that one.
32:49
You'll also see these little numbers here. Which I sometimes get asked about there.
32:58
Ignore the pop ups is not terribly useful, but essentially what these numbers say are this.
33:07
These are the number of groups who have chosen these projects as their first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth choice,
33:13
and also the number of students who have selected this project but not ranked it as one of their first six choices.
33:21
They've just expressed some general interest and. It may not bother you that much for the purpose of this ranking process,
33:28
but sometimes particularly for the large types of projects like your final year project,
33:36
students will look at these numbers and will decide what if another 20 groups of ranked this is their first choice,
33:41
then the odds are against all group getting this. So we'll use our choice to select some different projects.
33:47
So if, for instance, you've chosen the First Choice and no other groups have chosen it, then you're pretty much guaranteed to be allocated it.
33:54
So that's just a few thoughts about those. But obviously that depends how when people put their their choices up here and I mean,
34:02
you could be the scientists, some people gamify these systems as well,
34:16
and they put up fake choices and then change at the last minute as be down to happened in the past as well, just to just to change things.
34:19
So that really is the. So that really is the process you look at those you choose six things as a group and you rank them.
34:30
And with a bit of luck, every group will be allocated to a topic and then you go away and you work on that topic and you do some research,
34:41
put together a video and you try and make sure that we stay awake.
34:49
We mark them. Let's see, because when you're watching lots of videos, they luckily they're all interesting topics.
34:54
For some of these I've put up, I know nothing about, so I'm particularly keen to find out more about those, but they won't all be chosen this year.
35:01
And yeah, so that is the process.
35:08
All right. Any any questions will come back to the discussion about what time you want to do these things for later on.
35:13
I'm quite flexible about this one, but the late you choose the deadline, the less time you have to work on this.
35:23
That's the main constraint. So.
35:30
You know, you're actually a very. Everyone seems quite happy with this,
35:45
so hopefully now you have been able to to log on and you have been able to see who the group is and who the group leader is.
35:55
So it looks like we've got the vast majority of people in the year have joined us.
36:04
If by some some chance, then your group leader is unavailable today and you need the leader we are signing to somebody else.
36:08
Please let me know. So that one? Yeah.
36:17
So what would you choose, blinds? Oh, what would I choose?
36:24
Well, obviously I'd probably want to spend. Well, robot builders do not have to implement Asimov's three laws.
36:33
This one, because I've read I have on the shelf behind me pretty much all of Asimov's robot stories.
36:41
And I don't know whether you, Thomas or the majority of students have read more than the three laws,
36:51
but in every story I've read, which is over 50 now.
37:00
The three laws don't work, so I think Asimov never intended these laws to actually work.
37:07
So yes, I could have a lot of fun with that. I also think that the law governed ethical behaviour only gets you so far.
37:14
Oh, and I happen to know this group, and it's sponsored mainly by the US Navy actually working on building modern robots,
37:23
and they're probably further ahead than anyone else.
37:33
A combination of universities, including Tufts and Brown Princeton on the east coast of the United States,
37:36
they are really looking for a rule based approach, but constantly finding dilemmas.
37:46
So yes, I mean, I could have a lot of fun with that, and indeed, I was part of a group in 2015.
37:51
This will help you with your research.
37:58
If you're doing this one who would have sponsored where we push it, take it on a retreat in the new forest by the EPA.
37:59
So see, that's the Engineering and Physics Science Research Council to come up with a code for robotics for the 21st century.
38:08
I mean, our brief was a 21st century version of Asimov laws, all available online.
38:20
So we came up with guidance for robot builders, basically, which isn't much like Asimov's three laws.
38:27
So now I've pretty much done this one. Have all I need to do is a decision tree and say, Don't use the three laws.
38:36
What would you try instead? Well, what I think's worth researching is an ethical approach, which I don't think I actually talk about in the lectures.
38:45
But maybe some of you will know about from classical Athens Aristotle, how the system of ethics called virtue ethics.
38:54
He thought the main question of ethics is how to lead a good life.
39:03
And I think I would advocate a sort of 21st century version of that.
39:08
The main question in robot ethics is what is a good robot?
39:14
And in my humble opinion, a good robot is one that explores Mars looking for life,
39:21
but not one that puts people out of work, or even one that teaches its Imperial College for a whole bunch of reasons.
39:27
So, yes, that's what I do. Yeah.
39:35
I'm sorry. Oh, that is Sam. If anyone's looked into blase research,
39:40
then you might know that he has done quite a lot of work to do with robots and
39:44
ethics and associated areas and written and spoken quite widely on the subject.
39:50
So that can also be, I don't know, sometimes you choose those topics as well that it can be very good or very bad,
39:57
depending how you approach them, I guess. Yeah.
40:04
So I'm so not that heavily on the the questions so far,
40:09
so I hope that means that is because everything is really clear and you're just keen to to get going with that.
40:15
And hopefully, we'll manage to get in contact with the other members of your group.
40:25
Well, I hope everyone's ahead of me, Thomas, because I can't get into the DLC project portal that's rejecting my username and password.
40:30
OK, well, I will. I've been trying and trying, but so I just hope the students are.
40:40
I had on that particular coat, check that for you in a few minutes, play for that one because you were in there last year.
40:47
Oh yes, but it may not have rolled forward that. The we have said sorry to interrupt you, feel sorry because that's a joke.
40:57
The point is we'd like you to ask questions for that wacky access, a document about the project that should be on Kate.
41:07
So if you just click on Kate on the normal assignment link, you should be able to see that.
41:14
And I just have to update that time because it used to be a three p.m. deadline and I made it seven p.m. to give you a bit more time.
41:20
And I noticed I missed updating one of them. I will correct that again a bit later on.
41:27
Don't feel you have to keep working until seven p.m. on the last day of time, though, you're quite happy to have these in a bit earlier.
41:34
But it just gives a bit more flexibility for different time zones now or anything like that.
41:41
And the department tends to use 7:00 p.m. as deadlines normally, which I'm never that keen on, but that's my that's my view.
41:51
I prefer to be during the working day. Luckily, our stuff Christmas party has been cancelled, so I will not be on the night out on Friday.
41:57
But I hope the obvious reasons. Not even a virtual one.
42:10
No, not even a virtual one. I think my know the attempt to the Virtual Stuff Party last year.
42:16
No, that was that was enough. It's not quite the same. Even with the Christmas, hats were all sent.
42:22
OK, so you've got access, hopefully this time the brief. Have you all found the Blackbird site as well from the Centre for academic
42:37
English and been able to log into that because I know you don't use black much.
42:43
What should you do if your group does not respond to your emails? Well, first thing to do is just to.
42:52
Is to give them a little bit of time. We've got 188 people here, so that's 196 students, plus the two of us presenting.
43:02
So that is is most people in the year. So most people are about and working, but clearly a few people aren't here live.
43:13
Whether it's because they they don't know this session is happening or whatever, it might be there.
43:21
So if you've got enough people, then and you can choose the topics anyway,
43:28
the other group members will just have to be happy with the topics choices you have made because they're not here to take part.
43:33
If the group leader isn't available, then you'll have to ask me.
43:42
And then there are ways I can get that reassigned on the system for someone else to have a role.
43:45
It's just randomly assigned at the moment for that, for you to make your choices.
43:51
If people aren't active at all, then when you fill in the peer review later in the week, then you're going to give them zero and you're also going on.
43:57
You give the names of the people participating on the video. That's going to only include the people who participated.
44:05
But if you're worried you can't choose, you can't get hold of certain people, then you can contact me and you can contact.
44:11
Perez is the senior tutors and we can try. But if they've just decided to take an early break, then there isn't that much we can do.
44:17
But we will. We will certainly drop the email in case it carries more weight.
44:28
But generally, my my finding is most people in your year on your course are very professional about this and get on with things.
44:33
So if people aren't around, then there is usually a very good reason.
44:41
And so the question I would have at the moment would be if people have people are on a flight,
44:45
we would normally have people on a flight this this time of year.
44:51
But the imperial advice has been that people kind of leave the country early if they need to make sure they they get home.
44:56
So it will get you extra time necessarily. But it will only it will take somebody out of action for a few hours,
45:03
but it should take them out of action for long enough to prevent them working on the assignment.
45:10
When is the deadline for selecting the topics then?
45:17
I mean, we had we had one person propose eight p.m. to me, eight p.m. as a bit late for that because that means you can't start working there.
45:21
And so I would prefer it to be within a couple of hours so we can get this done and get this allocated.
45:31
A deal with any problems for that. So yes, I mean, 15:00 was sort of my thought.
45:38
Well, possibly possibly 4:00 p.m. for that.
45:44
Now, what time is your room? What time is your chess tournament?
45:51
Four to six, so we should definitely do that before the end.
45:59
I mean, my suggestion then, is we could be on the 3:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m. is I will is we will go maybe for 3:30 p.m.
46:06
And then that will give me just in case there are any.
46:14
Groups that need to the don't get a project in the first round that there is still time to deal with that.
46:19
Hopefully it won't be an issue. So, shall we say, 3:30 p.m. That gives you a No.
46:27
An hour and a half to discuss things between your group and put your choices up.
46:34
Yeah, you're all very noted, disagreeing with me, which is good.
46:42
So they. All right, any other.
46:49
Yeah, thanks. Probably fine. OK. Any any other thoughts?
47:06
No, if not, what will happen is we will be. They'll be around if people want to ask us anything or or discuss anything anyway for a bit.
47:15
But just to so just briefly go through the process again then.
47:26
So you've got the assignment brief, which covers most of this and you've got access to the project portal site,
47:31
which is used for many of our projects that just I know a few people didn't.
47:35
Money was able to join us at the start, so put the link in there again for that.
47:40
And then you're in your personal tutor groups. The group leader, who has been randomly chosen,
47:46
is going to go on to that site and select projects are interested in and then out
47:53
of the selected ones to rank First Choice Second Choice three to six choice.
48:00
And that will be used by an algorithm to try and allocate you to different projects for that.
48:05
But everyone in the group confuse the titles that you're starting points,
48:12
but only as a group leader can make the selections by all means go and look for them.
48:16
There are some, yeah, in my opinion, some very interesting ones and some which may or may not be very interesting,
48:21
depending on your personal views within the group for that.
48:29
But there are definitely some where you can find some which will keep you occupied.
48:34
But then and then the other thing is that there is more background research available to some of these to support them and others for that.
48:39
How long after three 30 will you find out what your selected topic is there?
48:47
I would hope by about 3:45. So that one's.
48:52
I will just now I will do everything then and just make sure if everything works first time, then you'll get together that quite quickly.
49:00
Never make any guarantees with computer systems. And I will I'll put a message probably on on it.
49:13
But if you do, you'll be able to log in and see it as soon as the allocation is done as well.
49:24
But just note, if you say 330, please don't submit your choices at 331 because the system will be closed off and this won't go through.
49:33
Now just another little hint when it serves to put six choices up, please do put six choices up and up five.
49:43
Because there is an automated algorithm that's used here and the algorithm,
49:49
if you've not put six choices up, it just ignores you completely and allocates everyone else.
49:54
So what I would do in that case is I would run the algorithm and then I will
50:02
go through and just manually check anyone who's put fewer than six shows up.
50:05
But chances are then a lot of your preferred choices will have gone by that point because of how this works.
50:11
And the odds are you're going to get something higher up in your list, but it all depends on what people choose.
50:24
That's just that sense. That's the nature of the Beast.
50:30
All right. Well, in that case, I hope you and you enjoy this topic.
50:38
There are various Q&A sessions to come in and ask us if you want to pick blase brains and by all means, do so.
50:42
Ask us about our opinions on many things. You're more than welcome to that.
50:49
Otherwise, do ask on air if you've got any questions as well.
50:56
Lenny, any final thoughts before we stop recording? Well, yes, I'll take questions and give leads.
51:01
But when you kind of built me up as an ethicist at the beginning, I think it's important for me to say it doesn't really matter what I think.
51:10
It's what you think that matters because you're the ones who will be in the project meetings.
51:18
You're the ones who will be taking the important decisions.
51:24
The only thing I would request is that you listen, take note of the opinions that are out there.
51:27
But in the end, you know, in the end, it's your opinion that's going to matter, not mine.
51:34
Yeah, and there's no guarantee that everyone in your group will have the same opinion.
51:41
That's okay because discussing it is part of the learning experience because again, in a work setting,
51:45
it's highly unlikely that everyone will agree with you straight away or that you'll be
51:52
lucky enough to be in a company where there's agreement on really important ethical issues.
51:57
So you have to learn to discuss it. Yeah, exactly.
52:02
Feel free to ask me questions either by email or I can get on to edge.
52:09
Yes, we're going to hang around a thing as well for a bit.
52:17
Two ends of the questions as well, but if you want to ask them and not have them on the video recording,
52:20
then what I'll do is I will thank everyone and I will play the recordings.
52:25
You can go away and start thinking about the the topics.
52:30
