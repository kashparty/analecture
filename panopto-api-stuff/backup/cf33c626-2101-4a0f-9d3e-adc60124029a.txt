Title: L04 - Boolean algebra and logic gates (part 1)
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova
Date: 19/10/2021
Hello and welcome to our fourth lecture and introduction to computer system,
0:04
and in this case, we're going to be talking about boolean algebra and logic.
0:08
So remember that we just looked at how to perform operations with binary numbers and how to represent them.
0:12
And the objective of this lecture is to learn at the end of it how logic relates to computing problems and a work with a computer.
0:21
And we are going to be able to represent boolean logic, boolean logic problems using twist tables, a very simple logic sequence and boolean algebra.
0:35
And also as part of this, we will see some how to perform some basic simplifications of boolean equations,
0:48
which is something that later on we will use to build more complex systems.
0:55
And again, like previous lectures, this one is going to be split into three different parts.
1:01
So it's easier to watch. So let's start with the first part, which is the more theoretical basis.
1:06
So and let's start with defining what logic is.
1:14
So if we look at the dictionary that come here, some of the definitions we can see about logic, it's a reason or some judgement.
1:19
It's a system of principles, of reasoning.
1:28
And it can also be defined as the science that investigates the principles of governing, correct or reliable inference.
1:32
And this is basically it started logic as a branch of philosophy, although, as you will see,
1:41
we are going to be using it to build circuits that later on we will be able to use to solve problems with a computer.
1:48
And as you will see, we already use logic all the time.
1:57
So for that, we have prepositional logic, which is something that the ancient Greek philosophers created to formalise arguments.
2:02
And now preposition in prepositional logic is a statement that can either be true or false false.
2:14
So remember, this is just like binary one or zero two or false.
2:21
And these prepositions can be compounded using three basic operators, which are going to say we had we are going to see.
2:25
No, and they are and are not.
2:36
So let's see, a very simple example here, we have two propositions, each of which can either be true or false.
2:42
The first one, it is raining. And the second proposition is the weather forecast is bad.
2:49
So one very fitting for London proposition that we can look at is by combining them is it is raining or the weather forecast is bad,
2:55
although that's not true all the time. So as you can see, we can assign values to prepositions, so, for example,
3:06
I can say I will take an umbrella if it is raining or the weather forecast is bad.
3:18
So this means that the preposition I will take an umbrella is the result of a boolean combination of two other prepositions,
3:26
which are it is raining or on. The other one is the weather forecast is bad.
3:34
So basically we can write this as a let's say, formula where we say I will take an umbrella equals it is raining or the weather forecast is bad.
3:41
And this is these are the basics of propositional logic.
3:52
So another way we can think about this is by using diagrams in this case, we have the D or operation here as part of the diagram that takes to inputs.
3:58
It is raining is one of the inputs that can either be true or false.
4:11
And then it has another output. That is the what the weather forecast is back.
4:15
And then it has one result, which is whether it will take an umbrella or not.
4:20
So it's going to look at these two inputs and then decide if I am taking the umbrella or not.
4:24
So the simplest way to look at this is using turntables and now things prepositions can only take Tuvaluans,
4:33
true or false, we can basically express every single one of the possible outcomes, but using combinatorics.
4:44
So in this case, we have to input and output, which means that we have to.
4:52
The power of one is the number of inputs, possible combinations, which in this case, of course, it's four.
4:57
So we have here for each one of them the two inputs, and we basically run through every single possible combination.
5:06
And as you may probably imagine,
5:15
the result is this one where umbrella the output of this or operation is going to be true whenever any of its inputs is through.
5:19
And then it's going to be false when both of them are Fuld's. Now,
5:28
let's go a bit farther and look at how we can build more complex propositions by basically composing these diagrams
5:35
with these three basic operations and or not into larger diagrams that can express more complex prepositions.
5:45
So in this case, in this example, we've got I'm going to take an umbrella if or in this case,
5:53
like equals that the result of the operation if I am not taking the car and either the weather forecast is that.
5:57
Or it is raining, so basically this is how we would have writing and.
6:06
And using the car not. And either of these two, which is the R and the result is whether I'm going to be taking the umbrella or not.
6:13
And so you can see each of these complex, each of these prepositions complex are not can be written using a diagram,
6:25
using these three basic operations that we describe.
6:33
And with this, this is the end of the basics, and on the next part of this lecture, we are going to be looking at how to perform,
6:41
how to build an algebra of operations that is going to allow us to build more complex propositional logics using a boolean algebra.
6:48
And with this, I'll see you in the next part.
