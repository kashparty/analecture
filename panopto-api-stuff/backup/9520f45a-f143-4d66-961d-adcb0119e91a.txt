Title: Why study calculus in 21st century? (Live Recording 11/10/2021)
Category: COMP40016 - Calculus (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Paul Bilokon
Date: 24/10/2021
All right, welcome to your first introductory lecture on calculous, actually.
0:19
Is this your first lecture altogether? Have you had lectures before?
0:28
Is this your very first lecture in the Department of Computing? No, not since you've had lectures.
0:34
OK, so that makes my task slightly easier. Slightly east.
0:41
Yeah, OK, so we will talk about calculus today and we'll talk about why it's crucially important to be very,
0:46
very, very good at calculus in the 21st century.
0:59
But before we go that, I wanted to ask you, how do you feel about calculus in the 21st century?
1:04
So perhaps you succumb to the mathematical. A feeling of tension, apprehension or fear that interferes with my performance,
1:11
some of you may have felt that you have already studied too much calculus at school,
1:20
whereas others will feel no doubt that you have studied too little, perhaps the feeling that is that of hesitation or doubt.
1:24
Why would we need calculus in the digital age? Why should a computer scientist, engineer or programmer study calculus?
1:33
So in order to work this out, I suggest that we do the following.
1:42
We do a quick survey, so we do a quick survey.
1:47
And what I want to ask you guys is how do you feel about calculus currently?
1:52
So in order to take part in the survey, you can like hopefully this works.
2:03
Hopefully this works. Let me just let me send you the link to it.
2:10
So it's that's that's that's great.
2:15
That's great. So I'm seeing that that you guys are actually that you guys actually like it, will love it.
2:21
In fact, most people love it so people don't care about it.
2:28
Okay, that's fine. Some people hate it. OK.
2:32
So people are curious about it, but the vast majority, 80 percent, 80 percent love it or like it.
2:37
So let me send you the link in case you haven't joined it yet.
2:46
OK, someone says I love it. It makes me look smart. That's great.
2:53
I love this audience. Love this audience. Absolutely. So have we reached the limit?
2:57
Have we reached the participant limit? So let me. OK.
3:13
OK, so it looks like we have run out of space in this fall, but there is a small number of people who are afraid of it.
3:18
But the vast majority of people seem if you have voted, if you have voted close to this page,
3:27
so hopefully other people will also be able to vote in that case. So, OK, so we'll see.
3:34
But the vast majority, the vast majority, that's that's a college thing.
3:41
That's Imperial College for you. OK, but there are some people who are afraid of it.
3:45
And it's natural. It's natural. Even Einstein was afraid of calculus.
3:50
He said, whatever your difficulties with mathematics, mind are significantly more serious.
3:55
So, OK, so that's great. So people have been voting and.
4:03
Yes, well, what can I say? My next question will be my next question will be what words come to mind when you think of calculus?
4:10
What do you think of when somebody mentions mentions calculus and you don't have to use a houselights,
4:21
but you can use a houselights so you can use a houselights if you run out of space in the houselights.
4:28
What stress, differentiation, integration, fun area limits areas and volumes derivatives.
4:40
Paid grath precision.
4:53
Okay, complex, beautiful. Product rule.
4:59
Okay, well, that's what else, gradient descent, the gradient descent.
5:05
Well, that's interesting, self-inflicted by the general chain rule and gradient descent.
5:10
So that's very interesting. So that's rather interesting and.
5:17
Confusion. So the confusion, they say, always precedes enlightenment.
5:28
OK, that's that's good to see. So that's partial differentiation.
5:36
What I actually the way it looks like there are too many people right now using a harsh light.
5:41
So it looks like I didn't realise there was this limit. And fortunately, I do apologise for this.
5:49
So somehow I need to deal with this limit. So I somehow I need to increase this limit.
5:55
So, okay. Difficult manipulation divide by the implicit powers rate of change are useful.
6:00
So you guys actually are much friendlier towards calculus and hopefully towards myself the night than I expected.
6:10
This is this is very good variables, continuous romance.
6:19
That's interesting. That's that's good, that's and that's the way you can probably try now,
6:24
because I think that some people who have left this page, but it's all very close to 50.
6:32
So I think it may be maybe tricky to to join this page.
6:39
OK, well, this is Aftermath the. OK, well, that's that's a nice word map.
6:43
Judith hollered back propagation. So what actually makes makes this curious?
6:55
It's a quite a few people have, of course, mentioned differentiation and integration. It looks.
7:02
So some people have mentioned specific names. And this is great.
7:09
So what I wanted to really ask you guys, some people have mentioned things related to neural nets.
7:14
So my my next and final question for this quiz is, how do you feel about neural nets?
7:22
Because if you ask me if you like me, then when you think of calculus, what I tend to think about, I tend to think about neural nets.
7:29
Have you guys here at Dock build your neural net yet?
7:38
Have you guys built your first neural net? And you can unmuted yourself and you can tell me basically that's not a problem.
7:44
So have you got eyes yet built your first neural net?
7:53
No. OK, so we'll do that today. We'll do that today.
7:57
And I know it's about calculus. Tend to flow, certainly counts.
8:01
But we will do we will build a neural network today in a couple of minutes.
8:05
Well, I'll tell you a few stories. First, I tend to I tend to tell people stories.
8:10
I mean, that's that's that's what I do. But we will OK. Some people are doubtful about them.
8:14
OK, well, that's interesting. So we will look into neural nets and we'll see how we can be less doubtful about them.
8:19
But again, we see that a lot of people are curious and a lot of people love neural nets, which is great, which is great.
8:27
So excellent.
8:38
Excellent. So thank you very much for taking part in the survey.
8:42
I hope that was interesting and insightful. And what we will what we'll look at now is indeed 21st century calculus.
8:48
So that's what the subject is today. It's 21st century calculus.
9:00
And so we have looked at the houselights. We have done this now.
9:06
I just wanted to say that you may have heard people say in the 21st century,
9:13
you may have heard Gilbert Strang, who is actually an author of the calculus textbook he made.
9:18
He said in his essay, Too Much Calculus. All the rest of mathematics is overwhelmed by calculus.
9:25
The next course might be differential equations, more derivatives, and the previous course is probably precalculus.
9:32
I really think it is our job to adjust this balance. We cannot expect others to do it.
9:39
We know the central role of linear algebra. It is much more than a random maths course.
9:45
Its applications touch many more students than calculus. We are in a digital world now,
9:50
but I would argue that we are in a post digital world and that is what that is what we will talk about briefly this morning.
9:56
So let us talk about calculus and why it is more important than ever in the 21st century.
10:07
So ancient accountants laid tables in columns in the sand.
10:14
Trying to help them do that sums it is thought that the impression left in the sand
10:18
when the pebble is moved to another location is the origin of our symbol for zero.
10:24
The word calculus has the same source, since it means a pebble in Latin.
10:31
Nowadays it means any systematic way of working out something mathematical.
10:37
We still speak of a calculator. So calculator also comes from calculus.
10:43
Also comes Latin word for Pebble when referring to the modern electronic equivalent of an ancient substrate.
10:48
That's just a quick request. So someone is not a mute and there is some background noise.
10:55
So can you guys mute yourselves if we are not talking or asking questions?
11:03
OK. Still still noisy. Still noisy, let me let me look into this.
11:10
How do we how do we. How do we move to people here?
11:23
Does this work actually mean to everyone, but I've heard that you'll also be built by yourself.
11:32
Okay, so let me. How do I meet everyone?
11:40
I don't know how to do that. OK. Ah, excellent, thank you very much.
11:44
Thank you very much. So what were we talking about? So you do feel free to ask questions, feel free to interrupt me at any time, right?
11:54
Just if there is noise I'd ask you to do to yourself and then just amuse yourself when you speak.
12:02
Yeah, OK. That's worth. So now now it's, I think, much easier.
12:08
Do you guys agree it's less noisy now? Can you guys hear me still?
12:20
Yes. Excellent, excellent, fantastic.
12:27
So we were talking about pebbles and calculators since the English mathematician Isaac Newton invented the differential and integral calculus.
12:31
The word is seldom applied to anything else. The this particular calculus, the one we're about to study, is all about differentiating and integrating.
12:43
Now, have you seen the Apple logo? Have you seen the Apple logo?
12:54
The logo of Apple Computer. Yes, OK, now, does it look like this?
13:00
OK, that's because that's the old Apple logo.
13:15
That's the original Apple logo, not the current millennial minimalist logo of today,
13:19
but the the original one that was designed by Ronald Wayne in 1976.
13:28
Some people say that Wayne was a third co-founder of Apple.
13:32
Some people say that. But the first Apple logo actually pictured actually pictured Isaac Newton
13:38
sitting under an apple tree and an apple dangling precipitously above his head.
13:48
And the phrase on the outside border, read Newton and mind forever voyaging through the seeds of thought alone.
13:54
It was William Studley, an archaeologist and one of Newton's first biographers, that relayed the story that's taught by Newton.
14:04
After dinner, the weather being warm,
14:13
we went into the garden and drank tea under the shade of some apple trees on the hill and myself amidst other discourse,
14:16
he told me he was just in the same situation as when formally the notion came into his mind.
14:24
Why should that Apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought to himself,
14:30
occasioned by the fall of an apple as he sat in a contemplative mood?
14:37
Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the Earth's centre?
14:41
So Richard is wondering if that Apple is going to fall. I'm wondering that as well, so that so will work.
14:50
But but in the meantime, I have another story to tell.
14:58
And that story is, in fact, a newspaper article which was published in 1958 in The New York Times.
15:02
The title of the article was New Naggy Device.
15:12
Oh, the poisonous apple.
15:18
Well, there is actually a connexion between the apple that fell on Newton's head and the apple of Alan Turing, but we'll talk about it another time.
15:20
New naggy device learns by doing psychologist shows embryo of computer designed to read and grow wiser.
15:30
The Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk,
15:41
talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.
15:46
The embryo. The weather bureau's to two million seven 04 computer.
15:53
Learn to differentiate, not differentiate, but differentiate between right and left and 50.
15:58
After 50 attempts in the Navy's demonstration for Nuzman,
16:03
the service said it would use this principle to build the first of its Perceptron thinking machines that will be able to read and write.
16:08
It is expected to be finished in about a year at a cost of 100000 100000.
16:16
Dr. Frank Rosenblatt, whom you can see in this picture design of the Perceptron, conducted the demonstration.
16:23
He said the machine would be the first device to think about the human brain as two human beings.
16:30
Perceptron will make mistakes at first, but will grow wiser as it gains experience,
16:36
said Dr. Rosenblatt, a research psychologist at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.
16:43
Buffalo Set. Perceptron might be fired to the planets as a mechanical space explorers now.
16:49
There was a commotion at the Four Seasons Hotel in Civil War 9th of March 2016, a motley crowd of computer scientists, mathematicians,
17:00
go grandmasters, correspondents and photographers have descended on the head to sell out of all places, was no stranger to such diversity.
17:11
But modern glass and steel structures coexist with grand historic palaces within the ring of mountains.
17:21
And yet the event had an air of uniqueness and timelessness about it.
17:28
Something special was about to happen. Everyone was waiting for one man to leave, settle, although some would call him Sandover Strong,
17:33
so he had just turned 33 years old just over two decades ago.
17:44
He was the fifth youngest to become a professional golf player in South Korean history.
17:49
Today, he had an added responsibility that very few would be brave enough to get to.
17:56
That goal was invented 2500 years ago in China.
18:01
It displayed by two players on a 92 by 19 grid of black lines.
18:05
Greenpeace's stones are placed in the lines, intersections or points.
18:10
One player uses the white stones and the other black. The players take turns, placing the stones and baker points.
18:14
Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, although they are removed from the board.
18:20
If one or a group of stones are surrounded by opposing stones, in which case the stones are set to be captured.
18:27
When a game concludes,
18:35
the winner is determined to win a game concludes the winner is determined by counting each player surrounded territory along with capture stones,
18:36
comic points added to the score of the player with the White Stones as compensation for playing second.
18:46
So we see that someone actually was there and watched this light, which is rather amazing.
18:53
I agree that that's very nice. The event's uniqueness was not without two exceptions.
19:01
Something similar had happened in Philadelphia in 1996 and the New York City in 1997,
19:07
when Deep Blue and IBM Chess Computer played Garry Kasparov the world chess champion.
19:12
The 1996 game was won by Kasparov in 1997 by Deep Blue being the first defeat
19:17
of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions.
19:25
So today it is Saddle's turn to defend humanity's intellectual dignity and compared to chess,
19:31
Go has both a larger sport with more scope for play and longer games and an average,
19:40
many more alternative, many more alternatives to consider per move.
19:46
The number of legal board positions and go has been calculated to be approximately two point one times 10 to one hundred and seventy,
19:51
which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the known observable universe,
19:59
estimated to be about one timestep to the property, despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex.
20:04
So subtle arrives, he has already won 18 world championships, he will defeat Al Thigo,
20:14
a computer programme developed by Google, deployed in a landslide, he predicts, some weeks before the match.
20:21
So before and indeed, that's an excellent documentary on YouTube.
20:30
I certainly recommend that you guys just watch it. Very cool.
20:35
So some weeks before the match, you won the Korean youngin title, a major championship.
20:40
There is every reason to be confident. The match starts at one p.m. Korean time and still is in control.
20:45
This is likely to be an easy game for him.
20:54
Then comes the games, one hundred and second, so Alpha Go makes its move, settle, examined the boards, the board, he mulls over his options.
20:57
The minute passes by. Two minutes.
21:10
Then. Until he finally responds, his confidence begins to evaporate.
21:17
OK, so the six classical simple machines were enumerated by Renaissance scientists and that they were the wedge,
21:29
the inclined plane, the lever, the wheel and axle, the pulley and the screw, and they date back.
21:38
So, for example, wedges were found amongst the oldest known old tools of Gonner, Ethiopia, and updated to about two point six million years ago.
21:47
Whereas the inclined plane, the heavy stones in Stonehenge, about 3000 to 2000 before current era,
21:57
are believed to have been moved and set in place using inclined planes made earth.
22:07
The ancient Greeks constructed a paved ramp, which was six kilometres long videocast to drag ships overland across the Isthmus of Corinth.
22:13
So these are pretty old machines. In fact, it was Archimedes who famously remarked, Give me a place to stand on and I will move the earth.
22:24
That was a remark about one of these machines, the lever. So he expressed thus his realisation.
22:35
What do you recall the ones on the top left? And the top right, so the one of the top right is the wedge.
22:44
The one of the top right is the wedge, whereas the one on the top left.
22:56
So how could you guys tell me what's the one of the top left? Scale, but what is the leader?
23:05
Right, so that's the lever which is used as a scale or can be used as a scale and the weighing machine.
23:18
So. So just to they are the wedge the incline plane, the lever, the wheel and axle pulley and screw those who were the first machines.
23:26
And it's interesting to look at the history of these machines, but I'm not going to go that deep into it.
23:38
Leonardo Da Vinci, better known as the painter Mona Lisa, was also an engineer fascinated with machinery.
23:47
He invented the Strawbridge, the automated Bobin, Wanda, the rolling mill,
23:53
the machine for testing, the tensile strength of wire and the grinding machine.
23:57
He preferred to keep some of his inventions a secret in case evil people use them for evil ends.
24:02
So early work on the machines was mostly empirical.
24:09
It was based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.
24:14
But this was about to change. On 5th of July six thousand eighty seven, the humanity's understanding of machines was radically transformed.
24:19
Isaac Newton published his revolutionary work philosophy naturalist Principia Mathematica Princip's established the laws of motion,
24:33
which were henceforth to be known Newton's laws of motion.
24:44
And in the words of Isaac Newton, the Vulcan mechanic can practise what he has been taught or seen done.
24:48
But if he isn't an error, he knows not how to find it out and correct it.
24:55
And if you put him out of his road, he is at a stand.
25:00
Whereas he that is able to reason nimbly and judiciously about tiger force and motion is never at rest till he gets over every rup.
25:03
Newton's work was an upgrade on Aristotle's analytical and Galileo's experimental methods,
25:18
it introduced to the study of motion enough machines, the apparatus of infinitesimal calculus, the mathematical study of continuous change.
25:26
Calculus aims to study functions, processes that associate each element of the set a to a single element of A set B, for example.
25:36
For example, we have a function F of equals T squared.
25:47
That's a function dissociates each number T and two to another number two squared plus zero is associated to zero one with one,
25:52
two with four and three with nine. So we can plot this function.
26:01
In fact, let us do this in Python and we will be using some python in this course.
26:06
But it's not necessary for the examiner for the coursework. You don't have to use Python.
26:12
It's just a very powerful tool for understanding quite a lot of this stuff.
26:17
So, yes, it brings back Galileo's experimentation to mathematics, very powerful.
26:22
So let me perhaps let us plot this function, let us plot this function and let us understand something about it.
26:31
So there we go. OK, so I'm what I'm what I'm doing here, I'm going to create some point, so I'm going to pick 100 points,
26:45
starting with minus three, finishing with three, and they will be evenly spaced.
27:02
So I do pick lynch space from minus three to three and I take 100 of these points, then I compute the square.
27:08
So our function is just all of these points squared, right?
27:17
So I compute the squares. I import maths booklet.
27:22
What speciality, which is my maths booklet plotting library, and I produce a lot.
27:27
So who can tell me what this plot is called.
27:34
So who can tell me what this plot is actually called.
27:40
It's a quadratic function and the plot of a quadratic function is called a parabola, right?
27:47
So the function is a quadratic function. The plot is called a parabola.
27:54
OK, that's fine. So now we're going to use a little trick.
28:01
So we're going to use a little trick. So what we're going to do, we are going to.
28:07
What are we going to do? We're going to do this, we're going to.
28:19
And by the way, a ball flying through the air without a trace nutzoid.
28:25
It will fall to the ground under the influence of the earth's gravitational field.
28:29
The trajectory of the ball can be represented by the very function that we are considering in line with Aristotle's analytical tradition.
28:33
Newton's approach breaks a complex topic of substance into small parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.
28:41
So we consider a small change. Can you go see my mouse pointer?
28:48
Can you go and see my mouse pointer? Yes, excellent.
28:54
So a small change in time. Delta T. And the reason, what happens to F or this small change in time?
29:00
So the change in time is Delta T. We compute F a T plus Delta T. and subtract the effort T. So that's going to be Delta F,
29:09
so because our function is just to square,
29:20
this becomes T plus Delta T squared minus T squared divided by Delta T, then we unpack this expression here.
29:25
So we have T squared plus Delta to us to T Delta T plus Delta is what modesty squared.
29:33
And now what can we do. What can we do. We can. OK, T squared council's right, T squared council's,
29:40
and we can then divide everything through by Dr. T and we end up with this expression two T plus Delta T now
29:58
as Delta T becomes smaller and smaller and we approach a limit and we'll talk about limits a lot today.
30:06
So get ready. So I'm kind of preparing you for this discussion off limits, which will be rigorous, mathematically precise.
30:13
We'll talk about limits. We will figure out exactly what the limit is today as Delta T becomes smaller and smaller.
30:21
As we approach the limit, it vanishes and the rate of change becomes the derivative.
30:29
Right. So Delta F by Delta T becomes D.F. by DETI and we see that it is equal to T.
30:35
So the rate of change of F is proportional to T the constant of proportionality being equal to to this rate of change emerges as the gradient,
30:44
the slope of our current political graph. But okay. So any questions on this.
30:54
Any questions on this, by the way, feel free to ask me questions at any point in time.
31:00
Are we supposed to know people beforehand? No, but it's a good idea to learn it during this course.
31:06
Right. Um, excuse me. I'm sorry to drag you back.
31:13
Could you please go through the whole slide again on the debate?
31:17
Fire alarm is just messing up and I can't hear anything.
31:21
Oh, no problem at all. So in line with Aristotle's tradition and political tradition, what Newton did,
31:25
he broke down the complex topic or substance into small parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.
31:32
So we consider a small change in time. Delta.
31:41
So just from time to time to write from time to time to and and we look at the change in the function over this time.
31:45
Right. And that that change in the function is our Delta F, right.
31:58
That's the Delta F, so but let us write down what it actually means.
32:04
Right. The change in the function over the Delta T time interval is F.T. Plus Delta T minus F.T.
32:08
Do you guys all agree with this? So do you guys agree, sorry, say it one more time, please, sir.
32:16
The change in function right in the value of the function is F.T. Plus Delta T minus 50.
32:29
So that's the change in the value of the function. So time has changed by Delta T, so the function was.
32:39
F.T. here and then it's F.T. Plus Delta here, so we're just looking at this ratio,
32:48
we were looking at the ratio of the change in the value of the function as we move Delta T over time.
32:56
Right, divided by the delta itself, does that make sense?
33:04
Yes, it does. So we'll look at this in a lot more detail in this course.
33:09
I mean, this is just an introduction. I'm just throwing some ideas with you guys so so you can look at you can get a feel for the scores.
33:15
Right. But later on, we will look at this in a lot a lot of detail.
33:23
We will really understand this expression that is written here.
33:27
So don't worry if you are still hesitant about it, don't worry, we'll come back to it.
33:31
But our function is just a square, right? Our function, what looks like our function is just 50 equals C squared.
33:37
Right. So it's just scary stuff. So we might as well substituting what the function is doing.
33:45
This is first principle. Exactly.
33:53
So T plus Delta squared, that's 50 plus Delta T, so it's actually T plus Delta T squared minus T squared, which is F of T.
33:55
Do you guys agree. Do you guys follow up to know. Yes, yup, makes sense, divided by Delta T because we are interested in this.
34:05
What happens to the function divided by what happens to the time time goes by Delta T and the function changes as well?
34:17
OK, and now we can just expand the brackets here.
34:25
So we can expand the square and we obtain this expression here and notice that conveniently T squared cancels.
34:31
Can you guys see the T squared council's?
34:40
Yeah, so we're left with some Delta teams so we can divide through by the teams and we end up with two teams plus Delta team.
34:47
OK, agreed. So we'll look at this in a lot more detail.
34:59
We'll look at this in a lot more detail. And who can tell me what happens to Delta then?
35:05
Who can tell me so relax, let Delta t then to zero, right, we'll let as you said,
35:30
it approaches zero, it becomes smaller and smaller and smaller and in the limit.
35:37
And I'll explain exactly what I mean by in the limit. I'll explain exactly what I mean by in the limit.
35:43
So right now I'm talking informally, but in this course we'll be talking formally.
35:49
OK, so informally this Delta T approaches zero.
35:55
So this Delta F by Delta T approach is what?
35:59
What is it approach? What does Delta, FBI, Delta team approach as Delta T approaches zero?
36:04
Well, look at this expression here, it approaches to tea.
36:11
OK, so that is how you differentiate from the first principles, right?
36:16
So that approach is duty.
36:21
So as Delta T becomes smaller and smaller and as we approach a limit, Delta T vanishes in this expression and the rate of change.
36:24
And we have specialisation, by the way, we have this special notation.
36:33
Yes, it's Tuti. And this special notation is rather than writing Delta F divided by Delta T, we write D.F.
36:37
But when we go to the limit, write DFW.
36:46
Exactly. Tuti That's right. And we end up with a Soutine.
36:50
Okay, that's what we ended up with. Any questions on this.
36:56
Well, it's all very well to talk about it, let's actually look at let's use Python, let's use Python to show us what this looks like.
37:04
Let us, because it's all very well to talk about it, but let's actually see it, let's actually see it, let's see what this looks like.
37:16
So I'm going to use again matplotlib the library matplotlib.
37:27
So I produced the plot that that we have already produced, but then I'm going to animated.
37:34
Okay. You don't need to know how animated all just animated and show you how this works.
37:42
Okay, so I'm going to animate this and I'm going to.
37:49
Look. I have a video now. Can you guys see the video?
37:56
Yeah, what happens to the red line?
38:03
De. That's the horizontal line as Delta T turns to zero.
38:09
What happens to the red line? The hypotenuse of the triangle, what happens to it?
38:16
Can you guys get smaller and smaller? It also gets smaller and smaller.
38:36
But what does it approach? As Coy said, it approaches the tangent.
38:41
Look, it gets closer and closer to the tangent, to the curve.
38:46
Right, so, I mean, before it wasn't a tangent right at the beginning when it's large, right, it's not a tangent,
38:52
but as it gets closer and closer and closer, as Delta gets closer and closer and closer to zero, this line approaches the tangent.
39:00
Right. And D.F. Bugti, this ratio approaches.
39:11
Approaches. Approaches, the approaches, the gradient, right, so it approaches the greatest, who thinks this is pretty cool?
39:20
I mean, pretty cool stuff you can do with Python. So nice videos, nice visualisations.
39:32
There is the question. Thank you. There is a question, how can.
39:42
So the notebook I will share with you on materials along with the slides is just that I tend to share the slides after I have gone through them.
39:51
So can we enlarge the screen a bit? Yes, I think we can.
40:02
Sorry I missed your answer earlier. Are we supposed to learn by blood on our own in our own time?
40:10
That's correct, but I'm not going to be examining it.
40:15
I'm not going to be examining it. Yeah, but it's not a bad idea that will they will not I'm not teaching you programming.
40:21
You'll be taught programming in other courses. I'm currently just teaching you how to use Python as an experimental tool.
40:30
Okay. I'm just showing you how to use it as an experimental tool.
40:39
So I'll tell you how to how to view such notebooks and share the notebook with you, but I'll also tell you how to view the notebooks.
40:45
And for that, you need Jupiter, right? So this is what I'm using to display this notebook.
40:54
I'm using Jupiter. And my question. Yes, go on.
41:00
So from all the software used to display and do mathematics, do you prefer Jupiter notebooks in Python mathematical models or something else maybe?
41:04
Well, I like free stuff. Personally, Jupiter is three.
41:18
Mathematical motlop you need to buy licences for. So they're great as well, but I think if you get the licences from the college, that's great.
41:25
In this course, I'm kind of assuming that you have only access to free software.
41:35
Right. So mathematics is great, Matlab is great.
41:40
The reason I'm using Python is because Python is free. And what do you recommend Python overall?
41:46
I like both right. Or is very good for stat's. Right, Python is better for machine learning or is good for stats.
41:52
And Google collaborator is indeed a great place for running Python notebooks, so Python is very, very, very accessible.
42:02
So it's very easy to get hold of Python. So that's another reason why I'm using Python.
42:12
But I'm not I mean, I actually have used Mathematica, have used Matlab, I have used Octave.
42:17
But nowadays in the machine learning world,
42:24
most people use Python and I'm trying to teach you something that is probably the most universally useful thing.
42:27
OK, can you guys see how this triangle, this triangle, by the way, is just a visualisation of this formula that we have been looking at?
42:35
It's just a visualisation of the formula that we have been looking at.
42:44
Yes, we have code consolidates. Edit you can not just open it can even educated Igbos.
42:48
So it's quite powerful nowadays be as code, but you don't need this code.
42:54
Right. So I'll explain to you in a few minutes how to display these graphs, how to display these notebooks.
42:59
OK, let's go back. Newton's work.
43:05
Newton's work caused a massive, massive change in society, massive change in society.
43:10
So so that you can sort of understand what it's what it's what it did.
43:20
And you probably know this already, but l l just it's linked to the history of Imperial College, so I might as well might as well mention this.
43:30
George Smith said no one could deny that the science had emerged, that at least in certain aspects so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before,
43:39
that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally.
43:49
The challenge to philosophers then became one of spelling out first the precise nature and limits of the knowledge that entered the science
43:54
and then how methodologically this extraordinary advance had been achieved with a view to enabling other areas of enquiry to follow suit.
44:02
OK, which historical period is pictured in this painting?
44:13
Which historical period is picture to this painting?
44:21
So I'm telling you what this is, this is Wentworth works for oil and steel manufacturers and exporters are in Sheffield, England, circa 1860.
44:26
So that is the Industrial Revolution.
44:37
That's the industrial revolution. So we'll talk about the Victorian age. Yes.
44:41
So Victorian era coincide well, overlapped with the Industrial Revolution and.
44:44
And this year. This here.
44:54
The Industrial Revolution. OK, let me go back actually a step let me go back a step.
45:01
Within the next century, the improved understanding of the laws governing motion and by implication, machines led to a quantum state.
45:09
Qualitative change, the industrial revolution. It began in Great Britain, which became the world's leading commercial nation by 18th century.
45:16
The first practical fuel burning engine was invented in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen.
45:24
Newcomen steam engine was improved upon by James Watt. In 1776, the Watt steam engine became the workhorse of the Industrial Revolution.
45:29
Wilkinsons precision war machine was used to produce Cossar and piston cylinders for its invention.
45:37
The British landscape, as you can see, was being transformed by the machines and the emerging industry.
45:43
Large factories were springing up all over metropolitan areas as manufacturing capacity exploded, aided by steam engines and copious supplies of coal.
45:51
In an 1838 speech in the House of Commons, Benjamin Disraeli referred to Britain as the workshop of the world.
46:00
And you know, the South Kensington, right? So you must be you must be now used to South Kensington.
46:09
Right. Exhibition Road. Right. And so, you know, the South Kensington campus of the College London is sandwiched between two streets,
46:16
Queen's Gate in the West and Exhibition Road in the east.
46:25
So do you know whence the name Exhibition Road is derived? Which specific exhibition is this referring to?
46:30
The great exhibition. That's exactly right, and this is the great exhibition, and first of May 1851, over half a million people marched in Hyde Park,
46:46
London, just across the road from the college to witness the opening of the great exhibition of the works of industry of all nations.
46:57
The great exhibition was organised by the civil servant Henry and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch, Queen Victoria.
47:06
Charles Darwin. Karl Marx. Michael Faraday.
47:15
Samuel Colt. The Writer. Charlotte Bronte.
47:18
Charles Dickens. Lewis Carroll. George Eliot. Alfred Tennyson.
47:23
William Thackeray were all amongst the guests. The exhibition was to become the biggest display of objects of industry from all over the world,
47:29
with over half of it given over to all that Britain manufactured.
47:38
And machines, machines were in the limelight amongst the exhibits, Frederic Bakewell demonstrated a precursor to today's fax machine.
47:43
The American Matthew Brady was awarded the medal for his daguerreotypes.
47:54
William Chamberlain exhibited what may may be the world's first voting machine and so on and so forth.
47:59
So we have massive change that resulted from Newtonian thinking,
48:05
the Newtonian cosmology of the mechanical universe promoted to drive to mechanised human activities at a large scale,
48:11
a drive which underlay the development of new machinery and the capacity to industrialise.
48:18
Indeed, it does not seem an overstatement to say that you don't need mechanics provided the intellectual basis for the first industrial revolution,
48:24
which in its two stages was almost wholly mechanical, brought together by a shared technical vocabulary of Newtonian origin,
48:31
engineers and interpreters like Bolton and what negotiated in some instances battled
48:40
their way through the mechanisation workshops or the improvement of canals,
48:45
mines, harbours. By 1750, British engineers could talk the same mechanical talk.
48:49
They could objectify the physical world, cease operations mechanically and factor their common interests and values into their partnerships.
48:55
What they said and did change the Western world forever. Then a second industrial revolution happened and that was effectively electrification.
49:04
See a painting here. So maybe someone could tell me what this painting is.
49:14
And electrification was led, if you like, by Michael Faraday, which was one, incidentally, that is Manifest Destiny.
49:20
Exactly. That is Manifest Destiny. And the painting is called American Progress by John Lucas.
49:28
And the woman is the personification of Columbia, personification of the United States, as you can see, she's carrying a telegraph wire in hand.
49:35
And yes, and incidentally, Michael Faraday, who was an initiator of electrification, was one of the judges of the Great Revolution,
49:48
which took place just across the road from Imperial College in Hyde Park down Exhibition Road.
50:00
OK, is that interesting? Did you guys know about this? This is just the history of your college as well.
50:08
Imperial College is quite intimately connected to the great exhibition.
50:13
But it wasn't just Faraday, it was Bekesi Ampere Cuke Wheatstone, Graham Crompton, Davy Petrie, St. Yablokov.
50:20
There were all heralding the new era of machines powered by electricity, the era of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla now.
50:33
But there was another revolution, which you can see here.
50:41
So are moving forward in history. And who can tell me which age is depicted here?
50:45
So this is the digital revolution, but which age were we in?
50:52
Or are we some people would say, oh, but what what age?
50:58
So someone said it was the victory. The Internet age, it's also known as the digital age, the information age, the digital revolution.
51:02
So if we look at the timeline for this, it's so roughly, as you said, 1960s, 1968,
51:13
the first message was exchanged that we had optical fibre, Satara computers, mobile phones.
51:20
Microsoft was founded in 1975. Apple was founded a bit later on.
51:26
It's actually earlier the 90s. Right. So I think we are now in a different age.
51:31
And that's my argument for studied calculus very, very, very, very carefully.
51:36
Right. So this is, if you like, the timeline of the information age up to twenty seventeen.
51:41
We are now in twenty twenty one. And what is happening in twenty, twenty one.
51:48
In fact, I would go back to what, what Marvin Minsky said in his Turing Award lecture.
51:56
Computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified with it.
52:05
So you could if you think about Newton's machines, they were really very dumb machines, very simple machines.
52:14
There were an upgrade on the classical machines, but there were still you wouldn't call them intelligent.
52:20
Then you had computer programmes and now we live in an era of truly intelligent machines.
52:29
So this is unprecedented. This is something that, you know, it's it goes beyond the digital age into perhaps the post digital age,
52:38
computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified by the programmer.
52:50
Could I say that again? It's cut off. OK, so we had dumb machines, the classical machines.
52:59
We had relatively stupid machines during the industrial revolution.
53:06
We had smarter computers during the information age.
53:10
And now computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified by the programmer.
53:16
OK. Oh, the fathers of A.I.
53:27
So do you guys know these people? You guys know them.
53:32
So it's a good idea to know them, who can tell me, who can tell me, who can name at least one of them?
53:41
Jana Licorne. Young Licorne is on the left.
53:49
That we have Benja in the middle and the person on the on the right is Geoffrey Hinton.
53:55
That's right. So the.
54:02
Expansion, the rapid expansion of deep learning led to truly intelligent machines that could do truly intelligent tasks,
54:09
as we can see, for example, they can they can do groundbreaking scientific work.
54:18
For example, they could distinguish cats from dogs. That's one of the use cases.
54:25
Okay, that was that was a slight joke, but indeed it was a major competition organised by Google to distinguish cats from dogs.
54:38
And it's an easy task for a human being, but it's a pretty difficult task for a machine.
54:45
It turns out that that task was cracked and electronic trading.
54:51
So my background is actually in electronic trading.
54:57
And I have worked as a quant for many years, and that is where I used the mathematics that will be teaching this course for electronic trading,
55:02
and that's where a lot of machine learning is used. Alpha Field, Alpha Fold is very, very interesting.
55:12
Alpha Faulds. What a protein does largely depends on its structure.
55:22
A major goal of computational biology has been to predict a proteins three dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence,
55:30
the protein folding problem. Oh, OK.
55:38
The question is, what is electronic trading? It's using machines, including A.I. and Amelle,
55:42
artificial intelligence and machine learning to place trades and hopefully, hopefully, if you are successful, make money.
55:51
OK, that's what electronic trading is.
56:01
Rather than trading by hand what is known as voice trading, manually placing orders, it's using machines to place orders and hopefully profit from it.
56:03
OK, going back to Alpha fold the protein folding problem.
56:17
A solution to this problem could help accelerate drug discovery by replacing slow,
56:23
expensive structural biology experiments with faster, cheaper computer simulations.
56:27
It would also enable researchers to reduce protein function from genome sequences.
56:32
The protein folding problem students a grand challenge in biology for the past 50 years.
56:36
And that was cracked, largely cracked by deep, wide only recently using neural nets as well.
56:43
What I'm going to demonstrate is a slightly simpler task, but still quite challenging that of handwritten digit recognition.
56:50
That of handwritten digit recognition. So we'll go back to our python, right, so we'll go back to Python and we will do the following.
56:58
You will build your first neural net today in this course.
57:09
That's what we'll do. So neural networks,
57:15
we're going to tackle a classical machine learning problem and this hendrickx digit classification given an image and it's a very noisy image,
57:21
which, as you can see, it's it's drawn by a human. So they are not they don't really look the same.
57:29
Some of them are quite difficult to read, even for human. So the goal is presented with the with the pixellated.
57:34
Well, what would the image. Right. Represented by pixels to work out which digit it is.
57:42
OK, so each image in the MNM is a classical data set and this is a classical dataset used in machine learning.
57:48
So every image is twenty eight by twenty eight pixels and contains a centred greyscale
57:58
digit will flatten each 28 by 28 image into a 20 watt 784 dimensional vector.
58:04
A vector is just a sequence of numbers. Right. So a finite sequence of numbers.
58:12
So what sequence. OK, I don't want to use the word sequence.
58:18
It's, it's, it's a list of numbers. I'll use the word sequence today in a very different sense.
58:22
So we'll use the word sequence today a lot. Our output will be one of ten possible classes, one for each digit.
58:30
So we want to show the computer a picture and we want it to output zero.
58:38
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Any questions of this?
58:43
Any questions of this? So in this context, what is the vector, what is the vector, the vector, so.
58:54
OK, so let me show you this. This is a scalar 35.
59:08
Right, it's a single No. A vector will be something like this 35.
59:18
Seventy seven, minus five. That is a vector.
59:27
So it's. This is a three dimensional vector, it's just a list of three numbers.
59:35
OK, yeah, so the vector that we want the neural network to to produce is something like this zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero.
59:44
Yes, exactly. Like. And Haskell, does orientation matter?
59:59
Not for my discussion here. That's zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
1:00:04
OK, so watch which number, which digit does this vector encode in this example?
1:00:13
Which digit does this veteran code? Six.
1:00:20
Exactly. However, the neural network that we are going to build, that's lots of success.
1:00:27
The neural network that we're going to build will output something else, it doesn't know exactly what this digit is.
1:00:34
So it will say something like not went well, maybe not went to for this one.
1:00:42
Maybe not. Point one, maybe another, not one, not one, not but one since I was that six earlier corrected but.
1:00:49
You said that it was six, the other victor. How is that again?
1:01:06
Oh. Let me go back to. Because this is zero, this is one, this is two, this is three.
1:01:10
This is for this five. This is six. So it's in the six digit six index six index.
1:01:22
So is the index. Is not the index is six.
1:01:31
This is called one hot encoding. One hot encoding, so in code six using a vector of zeros and ones.
1:01:35
We encode six using a vector of zeros and ones.
1:01:49
Does that make sense? It's just a technical thing, right?
1:01:56
I mean, it's not super important, but that's something you will know you will learn in your machine learning course.
1:02:00
OK. So the photos are just pixels.
1:02:05
That's right. So this is what we do.
1:02:10
We take our data, there are thousand images and we split them into 60000 images for training and 10000 images for testing
1:02:18
because we don't want to use the same data as we trained the neural network for testing how well it behaves.
1:02:31
So we split it into a training set and the test set.
1:02:37
So what do we really care about? We care about how the neural network performs on the stuff which it hasn't yet seen.
1:02:42
So how performs on the test set? So this is what the images look like, right?
1:02:48
I hope this works. Oh. Let me just reload the libraries and let me.
1:02:58
Let me do this. OK. Does everyone agree that this is five?
1:03:18
Yes. OK, excellent. And it's also labelled so this is labelled data, so we're using supervised machine learning.
1:03:28
So well, we are telling look at this image, this image here that we have on the screen and this is five.
1:03:36
So we're instructing the machine. We are telling you this is five. This is four.
1:03:44
This is seven and so on. OK, so we have now we need to preprocessed our data a little bit, so what we're going to do,
1:03:48
we're going to normalise the pixel values initially between zero to one hundred and fifty five.
1:03:58
Push them into minus a half to a half, just so we normalise them, we transform them and we flatten them, so instead of two dimensional vectors,
1:04:06
we flatten them into one dimensional vector, just a instead of them being twenty five by twenty eight by twenty eight.
1:04:15
We have a single vector with seven, seven hundred and eighty four numbers.
1:04:25
OK, that's what we do.
1:04:30
So we do this, then we build a neural network with three layers, 64 neurones in the first layer, 64 neurones in the second layer and then the output.
1:04:32
We want these ten remember ten values which will tell us which of the digits this is.
1:04:44
OK, so we build our neural network.
1:04:52
We compile the neural network and compilation of a neural network is an optimisation procedure, and I'll talk to you about it in some detail.
1:04:57
And don't forget, this is a calculus course.
1:05:06
I know I'm showing you neural nets, but I'll tell you in a second why what we do this course is incredibly important for neural nets.
1:05:08
I now fit this neural network. I'm going to take five epochs to do this.
1:05:20
So I've taken five bucks to do this and now I'm going to evaluate it and I get 96 percent accuracy on the test set.
1:05:41
So let us stress this, so I'm going to save my model reloaded just in case, and I'm going to take five images from the test set.
1:05:52
And I'm going to predict predict, meaning just I'm going to look at these images and work out which digit it is.
1:06:04
So I get seven two one zero four and the correct answers are seven two one zero four.
1:06:13
So we have just talked the machine to read.
1:06:18
With ninety six point seven percent accuracy, who thinks this is very Michael?
1:06:25
Just more epochs always mean more accuracy. No, because you can be overfitting, you can be overfitting.
1:06:34
Right, so we have just taught the machine to.
1:06:42
To treat, OK? So you will learn a lot more about this.
1:06:48
In your career here at the Department of Computing, how many test images were used, only the ones showed?
1:06:57
No, we have used 10000 test images, so we have used 10000 test images.
1:07:05
So how does the average seven to one 04 show us the answer again?
1:07:11
OK, I just picked five of the digits. I just picked five of the digits over here from the test set and I've asked the machine to tell me.
1:07:17
Sorry. To predict.
1:07:30
I've asked the machine to predict what the what the values of these digits on the machine came back, back with seven to one, zero and four.
1:07:34
Became seven to one zero four, and I checked because I know there they have already been labelled, this is the so-called labelled data.
1:07:43
So I know what the labels are and these images and they are indeed seven two one zero four.
1:07:52
So I got them all correct. It got them all right.
1:07:58
So could you please show us to those five past images themselves?
1:08:03
OK, my computer format. Yes, let us look at them.
1:08:10
That's the first one. That's the second one, so you've got it wrong, actually, by the looks of it.
1:08:28
Because this is zero. No, this should be oh, sorry, this is strange, but, you know, this is wrong.
1:08:44
So this should be test images. To. One.
1:08:49
Zeira. Or so these are the images that it's actually processed.
1:09:14
Wow, that's pretty cool. Those. So that's what it has learnt to distinguish, so there are quite a lot of comments on the chat.
1:09:27
I mean, I wasn't able to catch up with all the comments, but the reason I'm showing you this in a calculus course is because the training
1:09:37
procedure from neural networks called back propagation is all about calcaneus.
1:09:48
Back propagation is a repeated application of the chain rule going back.
1:09:55
The neural net, right, and we will talk about back propagation towards towards the end of this course,
1:10:01
you will understand how neural networks are calibrated using back propagation.
1:10:08
Okay, so this is all about CalCars, hugely, hugely important,
1:10:15
not less important than linear algebra that you will study the second in the second semester back propagation, very, very important.
1:10:21
A crucial application of calculous. OK, so we have built our first neural network, we have learnt we have taught the machine to read.
1:10:37
And just just a few quick words.
1:10:56
About what kind of attitude? What kind of attitude would help with calculus?
1:11:02
And perhaps in order to. In order to really understand.
1:11:09
Yes, and I did flatten and I took a two dimensional picture and turned it and basically turned it into a one dimensional vector.
1:11:24
I mean, the data is the same.
1:11:32
I just moved it around is just easier for my purposes to just take a two dimensional picture, turn it into a one dimensional vector.
1:11:33
So how did Newton arrive at his amazing discoveries? When asked, he replied by always thinking onto them elsewhere, he explains,
1:11:42
I keep the subject constantly before me and wait till the first drawings open slowly, little by little, into the full and clear light.
1:11:52
In a letter to Dr. Bently, he says, If I have done the public any service in this way, it is due to nothing but industry and patient thought.
1:12:02
And towards the close of his life, he uttered his memorable sentiment,
1:12:14
I know not what the world will think of my labours, but to myself it seems that I have been.
1:12:18
But as a child playing on the seashore now, finding some people rather more polished and now some shell rather more agreeably variegated than another,
1:12:24
while the immense ocean of truth extended itself unexplored before me.
1:12:34
OK, operating agreements. OK, we enter an agreement with you guys, operating agreements that we stick with,
1:12:45
and we will make sure that while on this course we live by these agreements,
1:12:55
first agreement, respect the departments and colleges covid-19 policies because the schools will switch to face to face situation.
1:13:01
We all need to be very mindful of the current situation and respect the rules that have been set in place by the code,
1:13:11
by the college took when especially when we come to the life, training is only front to back.
1:13:17
Unless you're asking a question. Always, always, always be on time.
1:13:26
It's a fast moving course, attend all lectures, Q&A and empty sessions, all of them do all exercises to the best of your ability.
1:13:32
Front to back means I'm talking. You're listening. Unless you're asking a question, then you are talking.
1:13:46
I'm listening. So not amongst each other when you're in the room.
1:13:52
That means the lecturer is talking. You guys are listening or you're answering back by asking a question or you're answering my question,
1:13:58
but the conversation is front to back and not back to back.
1:14:06
When does this become in person? I think it's in your Silcott timetable.
1:14:13
I can't remember exactly. So I need to I need to look at the timetable to see when it becomes in person.
1:14:19
In fact, it looks like it becomes a person on the 25th, 25th of October.
1:14:25
So it becomes in-person on the 25th of October. I think it's mixed, actually.
1:14:32
I think that will also be a remote. I think it will be a mixed delivery in places and remote.
1:14:37
OK, if need be. Do some Pitofsky. I think you can still join in line if it's in person.
1:14:45
Practise what you are learning here. This is an intensive course, keep destruction's to a minimum focus of the course,
1:14:55
if you have a problem about something or with someone in discourse, talk only to someone who can assist you.
1:15:03
If in doubt, ask questions. If you're lost, tell me as soon as possible.
1:15:11
We don't want to wait for people to be really, really, really lost, if you are slightly lost, it's OK because we can help you.
1:15:17
We could bring you back on track. So the moment you think you are lost or you might be lost, you just might be lost.
1:15:27
Let me know. OK, to the teaching team, Professor Harper said a lot is the original author of the course,
1:15:35
so I'm inheriting his lecture notes and using them so slightly expanded, slightly expanded version of his lecture notes.
1:15:46
So I'm teaching calculus, whereas Chaklala will be teaching linear algebra next semester.
1:15:57
Konstantin Goosies, the teaching fellow who is helping administer and organise this course.
1:16:05
OK, that's the teaching team and also part of the teaching team are the graduate teaching assistants whom you will meet during the MMT sessions.
1:16:14
And they are Daniel Corellas, Blanka Luca Greenlighting, William Hunter, Imam Hussein,
1:16:24
Zephania, Paul, Chris, Francesca Prigioni, Carla Sagara, Punshon Shukla and Joe Stacey.
1:16:32
There are two timetable slots Monday, nine a.m. to 11 a.m., it's a two hour lecture,
1:16:45
Tuesday, nine a.m. to 10 a.m. is a one hour Q&A, followed by new material.
1:16:50
Both of the above time slots will be used to introduce new material.
1:16:56
Yes, and I will share the notebook with you guys. I'll put some materials.
1:17:02
In addition, you will have a further one hour timetable slot for your group's MMT session.
1:17:10
Please, please, please make sure that you attend all of these sessions. New examinable material will be introduced at any time.
1:17:17
And it is your job to process it. Coursework and exam, there will be four course.
1:17:25
The first one will be set tomorrow.
1:17:33
And will be due at 7:00 p.m. on twenty sixth of October, the second will be set on the twenty sixth of October and will be the 9th of November.
1:17:36
The third one will be set on the 9th of November and will be due on the twenty third of the
1:17:47
fourth one will be set at twenty third of November and will be due on the 7th of December,
1:17:52
the course which adds up to 25 percent of the course. Thus each of the four or six contributes five percent.
1:17:58
The final exam is responsible for the remaining 80 percent.
1:18:05
We are using a discussion for Class Q&A. This is the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricular or administrative.
1:18:11
So there is a question, when is the final exam? So I need to look at the timetable.
1:18:22
Yes. So the final exam, I will check exactly when it is and I'll let you know.
1:18:28
I don't think the timetable has yet been released.
1:18:33
So, Ian, Ian's question, sorry, this is a mistake, I think it should say Thursday, sorry, it should say Thursday this year.
1:18:43
Should say Thursday, it's not Tuesday. It's Thursday. Sorry about that, Sir Ian, thank you very much for highlighting that.
1:18:57
So, in fact, I need to correct this straightaway. OK.
1:19:06
So I'll I'll correct this in the slides. So.
1:19:18
I'm very sorry, I'm completely, completely lost, it should be Wednesday.
1:19:28
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for correcting me.
1:19:34
Wednesday, not Thursday, not Tuesday, so it looks like I'm spreading confusion around me, so we could Wednesday, Wednesday.
1:19:40
OK, so let me just double check, look at the timetable and it is indeed Wednesday.
1:19:50
We are going to be using it, so if you have questions, post them on it and either myself or one of the teaching team will respond.
1:20:06
This is the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricula or administrative.
1:20:15
You will get faster answers here from staff and peers than through email and search.
1:20:20
Before you post hard questions and answers, you find useful, answer questions you feel confident answering.
1:20:26
Sure. Interesting course related content to its stuff appears OK.
1:20:32
Python is the de facto lingua franca of data science and machine learning.
1:20:38
Don't worry, if you don't yet know how to programme, we'll use it mostly as a calculator and as an empirical verification tool.
1:20:42
We recommend that you download the anakonda distribution once installed, kick off the notebook.
1:20:50
Google how to do this if necessary and it's not examinable. I'm not going to be examining your python knowledge.
1:20:56
In for this course is mathematical analysis, a straightforward approach by Benmore.
1:21:04
There are other books, many other books that you can use to supplement the score.
1:21:10
So, for example, if you are rusty on foundational concepts such as set theory and proofs,
1:21:15
I recommend that you look at this particular book by Martin Liebich,
1:21:21
which is a concise introduction to pure mathematics metrics basis and anthropology are dealt with.
1:21:31
What was the first book called Mathematical Analysis A Straightforward Approach by Bilboa.
1:21:41
So I'm not mentioning this in the slides, but if you really want to practise, I recommend Shalom's outlines advanced calculus.
1:21:49
They're really good and have a lot of work problems. So that's a great place to practise.
1:21:58
OK. No other books in other two books by Benmore, the foundations of analysis, logic, sets of numbers and the foundations of analysis.
1:22:07
Dialogical ideas. I just recommended Shalom's outlines advanced calculus.
1:22:20
In general, our clients are really quite good. And yes, so OK, guys, let's let's dive into it.
1:22:30
