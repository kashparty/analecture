Title: Interactive session 1
Category: COMP40008 - Graphs and Algorithms (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Iain Phillips
Date: 20/01/2022
OK. Right. So that seems to have started.
0:04
Could the House to mute everyone it says here, so how do we do that?
0:10
The participants came from the government, but I don't know if.
0:15
But I just want you to meet all.
0:26
I think your muted now in room three, right? In your yourself, sir, we can't hear you.
0:40
Let's look at cricket. Can you hear us online now? Yes, thank you.
3:21
Thank you. That's exactly what I did do something because I know.
3:26
Thank you for being with us.
3:42
OK. I think we're ready to start now. Finally, so apologies about the time it takes to set the thing up.
3:55
And so I've put in the Zoom meeting, I've asked people if they have any queries they want to raise,
4:04
but maybe you have some things you'd like me to talk about here.
4:15
So I want to. Ask something.
4:18
Want me to talk about something? In the adjacency list representation.
4:24
Is there any reason we have to use a linked list, or could we use a different sort of list?
4:34
Yes, OK, so the linked list is a sort of convenient thing to use for adjacency lists so that the questions
4:42
about whether we want to use a linked list here or just any any old list would do that would be fine.
4:48
The link list is quite a nice implementation of lists for this purpose because it allows us to to.
4:59
We just follow the list along and we can add links as many as we need.
5:06
But there's nothing, particularly as far as this course is concerned.
5:10
We're not really looking into the implementation of lists, so you can just think of it as a normal list if you want.
5:15
So I would say not particularly from our point of view, but what we do, what is crucial is that we do we don't get random access to this.
5:22
So it really is a list from our point of view where we move along the list.
5:33
So. So perhaps that's where the links sort of do make sense, which is not to sometimes later in the course when we talk about sorting.
5:36
I'm talking about I mentioned, I may talk about sorting a list. Here's a list of elements know one five zero.
5:46
Sorry, do I need to write bigger than that? I do. I'll try and write bigger in future if I remember.
5:55
OK, so here here's a list.
6:02
So we might call that a list, but it's really an array because I think of us as being able to get random access just by every index.
6:05
The zero one two three four.
6:17
Then I can just go into this list and find out what the element is at position two in the array.
6:22
So from that point of view, I'm thinking of a list as an array. Now, when it comes to the to the adjacency list representation,
6:31
I think of this as being you just get sequential access moving along the list like this.
6:40
So to get to this one here, you have to have gotten past these ones here because that's sort of the way.
6:46
And that gives us a sort of once you've got that representation of a graph that gives you a canonical.
6:51
In other words, the expected way in which you would access that graph basically unlike the adjacency matrix representation,
6:58
which gives us random access to any element in the matrix, you see.
7:05
So that's the point here, whether it's linked lists or something else is perhaps less of an issue here.
7:11
But the the point is the sequential access you get.
7:17
So we only get to this one after having gone through these ones here.
7:21
Mm hmm. Yes, good question. The questions will be entertaining doubts from the BNP or is that will we be sorry?
7:25
Sorry, say that again. Will you be entertaining doubts from the BMT? Sorry, I couldn't hear the first couple of words, will I be?
7:39
Will you be entertaining doubts from the BMB doubt?
7:47
Yeah. Uh, oh, I see what you mean if we want to ask things about the ones that you're handing in?
7:54
The PMD for this, well, yes, OK.
8:01
I mean, the whole all of this is supported by the PMC, so feel free to ask your Yuta about anything on the course, not just whatever you hand in.
8:04
OK. Feel free to ask me, of course, or put questions in STEM.
8:13
But yeah, well, in principle, if if people want to ask for a little hint or something,
8:19
maybe I can't really tell you before before next week or whatever how to do it.
8:24
Obviously what the answer is. But if there's something that's unclear in what I'm asking.
8:31
Or something like that. Then you can ask that. And what was I going to say?
8:37
Oh yes, I will be, as it says on its them, children kindly answered that one.
8:44
You will be getting answers to all of the tutorial exercises in due course.
8:50
I hold it back a bit when you have something, and it will probably come two weeks on Monday for that.
8:55
If there's nothing to hand in, then you'll get it the following week. OK, so you will get answers to all of these.
9:01
OK. Other. Yes.
9:08
So I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to see the chattier. Let me stop sharing so I can have a look at the chart.
9:13
That scene, is it possible to zoom in to the white board?
9:22
There is no one preset. Three zooms in more.
9:28
You can't see me in that case. Maybe you prefer that. So but.
9:34
Well, the things you would like to ask, yes. But seems to.
9:45
Why what? Why don't we? Well, maybe it's just a convention, basically.
9:58
So the question is, if we're using the adjacency list, why don't we repeat the loop twice?
10:03
So I've just put down some conventions there,
10:10
but there's nothing particularly different people might have different conventions as far as that's concerned.
10:14
So again, I don't see any other immediate. Oh yes, I can see room three of the right.
10:25
There it is. Yes, I see. Oh right.
10:32
Okay, thank you. Let's see what it says. You know.
10:37
When you set the graph is a set of nerves. Well.
10:45
One of the examples, two girls with different despite having the same labels.
10:53
Uh. Yeah, I don't look quite sure what example that is due.
10:59
Do you know where that example was with Page on the sly as it was or anything like that?
11:08
So it was autumn organisms, okay? So that's.
11:23
Go through. OK, so let's.
11:31
So this grew. OK, so that is one of the first lines on all the movies.
11:47
The question is about whether nodes are just the labels.
12:01
Can I have extra structure to them if I understood the the question?
12:06
Do you want to think about your question? Could potentially scroll down a bit more.
12:10
Yeah, sure. Further, it's a bit further.
12:19
To keep it where you started talking about Muslims, Sims says, if you say it's done oh right, yes or yes, I was just doing, Yeah, yeah, here we are.
12:26
Yet so on that example, I think like the example you gave would be like, say, yes,
12:35
it's like a 90 degree clockwise rotation, and that would like it more from ice and more freedom from the golf to itself.
12:44
This, like it's a across, is it is just like a set of like, say, one two, three four and then the ox between them.
12:55
Then like, isn't that just the same growth?
13:03
So how could that be like one or two more them if it's just like a mapping from the same set of notes to the same set of notes?
13:06
Yeah. So we have got all auto movies is a mapping.
13:13
I'm drawing it on here, so it is from the graph to itself.
13:17
This is g all over again here. This is another copy of Gee, if you like, so the definition still makes sense, I mean,
13:21
we define what it meant for a G1 to be ISO morphic to G2, but the G1 in the G2 can be the same girl.
13:30
But I'm not assuming any particular structure on the nose here.
13:40
I'm just assuming that they have labels and this is this is actually the same graph here.
13:42
But if we want to do the rotation at some point, another colour here is a red pen.
13:48
So say we're doing the 90 degrees clockwise rotation.
13:58
So that means that the one here is going to map over to the two, let's say,
14:04
and the two maps to the three and the three maps to the four and the format to the one.
14:10
So this will be F.
14:18
And similarly, if we enabled mean, then if we take, we take the edges, then we could say that gee of one two is going to be two or three.
14:24
If we name this age is one to name, this age is two three.
14:39
I should really use a different colour for that. So here is here is the mapping.
14:48
So this is, if you like, got that one green light that.
14:58
So that's that's an automotive ism, one can check that it does satisfy the property,
15:05
so I think it's fairly obvious because of the symmetries in the graph like that.
15:11
So we're not really I mean, going back to your original question, we're not really adding any particular structure here to the nodes.
15:17
They just use the same graph here. And what this shows is that a graph can have a non-trivial automotive ism.
15:25
Some graphs don't because they have no symmetry in them as it were.
15:35
But this one's got quite a lot of symmetry, so we have got two more prisms that we can define.
15:38
This is somewhat related to your question is somewhat related to the hand-in question for I think,
15:45
which is sort of meditate the difference between an automotive ism from a graph to itself and the nice,
15:50
the more present from a graph to another graph. But if you think about it, if these graphs really rise, the more effectively they are the same girl.
15:57
That's sort of the message for this week is that graphs that are small peak are effectively the same graph.
16:04
OK, there may be that we've labelled the nodes in the arcs differently, but a lot of that is pretty arbitrary.
16:11
OK, maybe meaningful. If we really think that this graph represents, you know, motorways between cities or something like that, it may be meaningful.
16:19
But in other cases, all we're interested in is fact that this graph is has this sort of square.
16:26
It's a cyclical graph of with full nodes, you see.
16:33
So there's nothing special about the way that it's labelled in the east and north is a more automotive
16:36
ism gets us away from how the thing is labelled to the more abstract view of what a graph is.
16:42
Yes, the question. Well, automotive ism is a special case of isotope ism, as you see in the definition at the top of the slide.
16:48
So not every item autism is an automotive ism because the grass might be different considered assets.
16:59
But if they are actually identical graphs, then as they are in this example here, then then that's a nice, amorphous.
17:08
But we can also say that it is actually an automotive ism in that case.
17:16
So it's a special case basically for.
17:22
Well, we have that example if we go back in the slides. Let's move up again here.
17:27
So this this example here.
17:36
We have two graphs, and what we've seen is that they are either Morphic, despite the fact that they are labelled differently.
17:40
And I've tried to make it a look at them look a bit different by just throwing them as a different shape.
17:49
But if you think about if you once you have the mapping like this mapping here,
17:54
the one two three four maps the bad C, then you can see that effectively.
18:00
This mapping, plus an implicit mapping on the arcs which we have given here, will actually show that these two graphs are the same.
18:07
Admittedly, they label differently, so we can't say that they are. Well, OK.
18:20
So about the same, I mean, east a morphett. But they're not the same graph considered as assets or whatever.
18:24
But whereas in this one, they really were the same considered as.
18:32
But it's not a very important distinction and in many cases with, you know, maybe sometimes we care because we want to say,
18:37
Well, look, you know, this graph shows something in this graph shows something else, but actually they have the same structure.
18:44
If you think about it, that might be an interesting thing to say in some context. But in other contexts,
18:50
the labels here are just one to three for just the purposes of talking about the graph rather than doing anything interesting with it.
18:55
So I could equally well have labelled them as five six seven eight. And the message would have been the same, basically.
19:03
Yes. Seems stop her so I can just see if this is.
19:12
Right. Yes. Would you be able to go with the general technique of constructing grass with?
19:20
Oh, yes. I saw all of it to the compliment. OK, so there are.
19:27
Two questions on the sheet. Let's share the screen on Love Real.
19:35
So there are two questions. One is construct a graph with exactly three automotive isms.
19:49
And the other one says, find a simple graph.
19:56
Like that, yeah, I think these are. Not quite sure what hints to give on this, but to me and I can give you a hint on Question seven.
20:03
Maybe I can give a hint on Question seven. The question is how we go about finding these graphs in general.
20:19
I'm not sure. I really know quite what to say about that.
20:25
But I mean, let's say that we were thinking about a graph with five or more persons or something like that,
20:29
then we might sort of we can sort of let something out of this room.
20:35
But this. OK, so let's say it was five or two more business we were interested in then.
20:44
We might think about something that's got five nodes, maybe.
20:58
So maybe one, two, three, four, five and then we might want this node to be able to map to each of those bones,
21:07
so we might say that these five nodes have all got to be similar in structure or something like that.
21:16
So I mean, we might be tempted to try a Pentagon or something like that. And see how far that gets us.
21:22
Does that have five automotive isms? I see some people saying yes.
21:30
So some people shaking their heads. So, well, let's think about it, so one, if we use,
21:40
I've sort of suggested a method in the in the lectures for counting the number of water more prisms.
21:49
So we might have a look at this one and see what we get.
21:56
So if we have a different colour again, let's look at one.
22:01
How where can one map to scope five positions? I think fairly, obviously so.
22:06
So for one, we've got five positions, so let's say that one is now fixed there.
22:12
And now let's consider two how many places can to go to.
22:19
Two has got two positions in deep because two could go here or here, you see.
22:24
So that's a. So if we fix to there, then we could go on to three.
22:31
How many places can three go to? Three is only one place.
22:37
And similarly, if you think about it four and five, so three, four and five wants one and two are fixed.
22:42
And obviously, therefore this arc is fixed, then everything else is fixed.
22:50
If you think about it, there's nothing more that can change while preserving the Connexions now.
22:55
This is obviously a different question from asking about bye bye ejections, guys asking how many by all their own five.
23:00
Then obviously there are many more, but we are talking about preserving the connectivity here, so wherever to goes to has to be connected to one.
23:11
So that just gives two or five as the possible options.
23:18
OK. Right. OK, so we haven't quite made it, but.
23:22
This is sort of relevant. I mean, they're both prime numbers, I suppose, or something like that three and five.
23:29
So it's sort of relevant to the question that was being asked about.
23:34
So what I would suggest now without and I don't want to give away the answer here, really.
23:38
But if you think about it, we want to sort of there's a bit too much symmetry here if you think about it,
23:43
because we've got the rotational symmetry like that.
23:49
But we have also, if you think about it, we've got a sort of reflective symmetry found that vertical axis there.
23:54
And indeed, obviously other examples. So what we want to do here is if we want to get all five going is to keep the rotational
24:05
symmetry because that was working well for us and get rid of the reflective symmetry.
24:16
So what we sort of high level answer to that could be to make this like a sort of directed edge is not that we could.
24:24
Think about how to simulate that in an undirected graph, if you see what to me,
24:36
because if if there is a nice symmetry here, then we can't actually flip across.
24:43
Well, it's this Oh, here, isn't it? If this was asymmetrical in some way, then we wouldn't be able to flip it.
24:49
But so that would be the key to answering this question, though maybe there are other solutions,
24:57
but I mean, this is sort of the way I would think about it, and this would also work for question.
25:03
Seven. So I can't really tell you how to do that without giving away the answer to Question seven,
25:11
which I'm not just not ready to do just yet, but there are multiple possible solutions so you can come up with your your own way.
25:17
But obviously this will mean adding some more nodes and arcs in order to simulate this effect of an asymmetry across this arc here.
25:25
So this is going to be replaced by some gadget as people like to talk about that a gadget that makes it asymmetrical here.
25:36
Okay. Yeah. But be careful that you don't introduce the new automotive system.
25:47
In the course of doing that, you might easily do that if you're not careful.
25:54
Okay. So I think that's the sort of hint for Question three.
25:58
Question eight is a bit more ad hoc, but I think I mean, they're fairly small.
26:05
It's just talking about grass with a small number of nodes and simple graphs, too.
26:09
I think so. And it's a fairly ad hoc sort of question.
26:16
You're talking about the complement of the graph. So I would think a hint here might be to think about cold analogies and things like that.
26:21
OK. No cold analogies from last term or possibly some of the lectures, if you're James.
26:29
And so I think that's about as much as I can say on that.
26:37
But yes, I mean, in general, it's an interesting question as to how you might construct a graph in certain properties.
26:41
And I would tell you, that's a hard question in general.
26:47
Okay, maybe some things are easy, like saying, we're going to put a click of a complete graph above graph of this size in it.
26:51
But other questions are quite deep.
26:57
Bonds that mathematicians have spent a lot of effort on over the years for our theory is very interesting and subtle subject,
26:59
but we don't we don't have the, you know, we're not able to go into those kind of details.
27:07
Obviously, in this course, we're just doing a little bit on graphs and then we can getting on to algorithms, using graphs.
27:13
OK, let's stop and let's see what.
27:25
You know, for all the movies, you just through permutations.
27:32
Well, I would be. I mean, in this case, permutations is, I mean, if we just look to put permutations on the five nodes,
27:38
there would be many more basically than there are or two more pieces.
27:48
So is related to permutations, if you like.
27:54
But I mean, if it was permutations, it would go five four three two one here,
27:57
instead of which it's more restricted, basically because of the way we've chosen our example.
28:02
But obviously, every example is different. If it was a complete graph, you would get all the permutations on the nodes.
28:07
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
28:16
Okay, fair enough. Right, your answer during point there. So other points from the room here.
28:21
Trying to.
28:29
So I think it might be worth it, should we do another example of this sort of counting the number more reasons I think that might be worth doing.
28:34
I was thinking that might be a good thing to do if the weren't all the things people wanted to talk about.
28:43
First of all, so some. Let's take a hexagon, maybe.
28:48
And I will no. No, the no, it's just so that we can talk about them, how many AutoML Vision was in this hexagon?
29:17
We could use the same method, so one can pretty obviously to six places.
29:35
And then two, it's really the same as the other example, isn't it three or five six?
29:42
Like that? OK, so it really just weakens, I think we can already see a little generalisation here to any polygon here, basically.
29:53
But but let's make it a bit different now. Let's add in.
30:02
Another rock like that. Does that make any difference?
30:10
Look. What's?
30:16
We go through it again, so, OK, so that was the old one, wasn't it?
30:25
So let's see, we've changed the example now, so we'll do it over this side.
30:28
So one, how many places can one go to? OK, so why is that?
30:33
Oh, yeah, but we can't talk about six and two because that is not preserved by automotive some.
30:44
Yes. Yes, exactly.
30:49
So we if we let's put that is quite helpful to have the degrees on here, so let's put them in green.
30:53
So this is two and this is two, that's two.
31:00
That's two. But these are three. OK, four degrees there in green.
31:04
So prima facie, we, you know, this can only map to somewhere with the same degree.
31:10
There's no other choice. So we would have these other options. But if you think about it, this one here is got one neighbour of degrees three.
31:15
This one's got zero neighbours of degrees three that's got one neighbour degree three.
31:23
This has got two neighbours of degrees three. So therefore it is actually fixed.
31:27
OK, I'm about to then say that we've fixed the one where it is up at the top.
31:34
We haven't moved it. How many places with two? OK.
31:40
So and so then what's the one, the two effects, then everything else is fixed as well.
31:47
Correct. OK, so we got down from 12 down to two just by drawing in that extra arc like that.
31:55
Let's. Now, you might be able to get this answer by just saying, well, obviously this reflects an old symmetry across here,
32:07
and that's the only cemetery I see and therefore the answers to.
32:28
So I would say you're right, but I find that a little bit dangerous in other examples,
32:32
because there may be multiple cemeteries, both rotational and reflection.
32:39
And some of them cancel each other out or whatever.
32:45
So if you do a rotation followed by reflection, followed by another rotation that might be equivalent to some other reflection or something like that.
32:48
So, uh, you easily confuse yourself that way, particularly in a larger example.
32:56
And this case, you probably got it right. But in general, I would caution against doing that.
33:02
I don't say that this method always works. It's a bit sort of rough and ready.
33:09
I don't claim that it always works, but it is fairly good at not double counting, basically, which is what you might easily do.
33:16
Either miss something because you aren't being systematic or else count
33:22
something twice as being two different things when they turn out to be the same.
33:26
Of course, if you're really careful and write down all the markings, then I suppose you you won't do that,
33:31
but that's quite laborious, so it's a lot less effort to just look at it this way.
33:36
All right. Well, let's try change our example again so we can take to the next step.
33:41
And maybe. And maybe what we could do now is perhaps just add another note here, so let's call this one server like that, right?
33:46
So. How many have we got now?
34:03
So we've got one load of degree three here, haven't we?
34:11
So we might sort it, so that's that we're looking at the degree.
34:16
Is this helpful to us list degrees one? Sorry, that's three.
34:19
And these are those are two. So I think that's a useful.
34:24
Is not sufficient. I mean, we can't say just because they've got the same degree that you can mount one to the other.
34:31
It's more subtle than that, but at least this rules out certain things that we can't do.
34:38
So given that this one is the one that's got degree three and this one's got degree one,
34:43
then it probably makes sense for the method to start with those.
34:48
So we might start with two. I'm pretty obviously. That said, we got one place to go to.
34:52
The seven is only got one place to go to and then we can move to one.
34:56
And how many places is that got to go to two and then three?
35:01
So. And the others have all got one place to go to.
35:11
So multiplying all this together. The answer is to again, we've got the reflection or symmetry coming through this note to,
35:16
in this case, note that then we could change the example again.
35:28
I suppose we could. What could we do to it?
35:34
We could put another low down here.
35:39
Eight. OK, let's try that one.
35:44
So I'll. Rub this out to avoid confusion, because I've changed the example now.
35:49
It's doing this off the top of my head, and that one's become degree three like that now.
36:02
OK. So what do you think there should be?
36:08
What's a good note to start with here? Three.
36:14
OK. So what can we say about three? Three has got the green two.
36:19
We've got three other notes of degree to. But.
36:30
It has to have it got this one's got two neighbours of degree three.
36:38
And that isn't true for the other one. So therefore three is one place to go to.
36:42
What would you suggest next? So three is fixed now, so the Find My Red Pen again.
36:48
There's lots of different oral sex. Right, so that one is fixed.
37:02
Well, let's go for four, then, okay, so let's try for. So the question is, is it really symmetrical around here?
37:08
And yes, it looks to me like it is basically. So I think there are two, as you say.
37:26
Yeah, I don't agree. Yup. Okay. So there's there's two there and then.
37:31
Well, we could do eight legs, couldn't we? That's an easy one.
37:38
There's just one for that. And then maybe two could be the next one.
37:43
That's given that four is now fixed. These ones, then everything else is now fixed, basically.
37:49
So basically, once you've got the three and the four here, then everything else follows from that.
38:01
So we're just going to get to automotive business again.
38:07
In that example, maybe that's enough of that.
38:11
But let's see what the might be in the church.
38:17
Nothing new. Right.
38:21
All the things you'd like to talk about. We haven't got very far this week, obviously, we will have more to talk about next week.
38:29
Everything from the you'd like me to go over again or. Think of me.
38:40
So, yes, I just mean, you've got the pointy sections, some of them may be before or after this session.
38:48
I know mine is coming along tomorrow, but feel free to raise any questions about that you want to go over in the lectures.
38:56
And the yoga may go through some of the exercises from here or possibly their own examples,
39:03
and they will be marking your work, except for the coursework which will be marked separately by duties.
39:11
Yes. Question. Because of a lot of fun to have.
39:19
Yes, it. Well, OK, so we're going back to the.
39:33
Well, these these all different graphs. I think we can.
39:46
Can we agree that they are different grass in the sense that they have the known set of nodes?
39:51
OK, they both got full nodes, but they are labelled differently.
39:56
OK, so to that extent, there are different graphs, but they're not very different because what we've seen is they've got the same connexion.
40:00
So we can say that these graphs the either morphic because we have a mapping there.
40:06
For instance, one maps to be two, let's do a, et cetera, like that.
40:10
So if you like what I could do, I could go to this graph here and cross out the a and right two and cross out the B and write one,
40:15
etc. Then I would have the same labels on the nodes, if you like.
40:26
And then it would be more obvious that they were the same graph. Admittedly, I would have drawn them differently on the page,
40:30
but this is even in our set and sets sort of representation for this or the adjacency list or adjacency matrix representation.
40:36
There's nothing about where it goes on the page. So the computer won't see where it is on the page.
40:50
The computer will just see the adjacency matrix. But if you're a computer and you look at these two graphs.
40:55
But instead of doing the one two three four, let's say I wrote that if I write the adjacency matrices in the standard order,
41:03
which is what I've got up at the top of this slide here.
41:15
Then it's not that obvious that they're the same graph you see, because I just happen to have ordered the matrix differently in the one or the other.
41:19
So but if we reorder systematically by reordering the the rows and the columns in the same way,
41:31
so I rewrite them as bad here, then you can see that it does come out to be the same adjacency matrix.
41:41
So the computer will then see that they are the same graph.
41:47
So you could say, Well, let's just let the computer chug away and and keep on changing the orders.
41:51
But the problem is there's in fact always that there is order. So that would take a long time.
41:59
Question. Yes. The. We have different senses of that, I mean, we could say that they are identical assets.
42:03
That would mean such as in the example that I've rubbed off now, I did make them identical grass because they would be labelled the same way.
42:17
And in the same order. But we're loosening that a bit here to say that these graphs are not the same in that sense.
42:29
They're not identical graphs, but they are similar in structure.
42:35
If you took away, if you abstracted away from the names that we've arbitrarily given to the nodes, then we can't really see.
42:39
Yeah, you're right to say that. Uh, well, they will be able to move it to any graph is automatic to itself.
42:49
That rather relates to Question four, though, I think that lot of.
43:05
Well, I mean, you can have an automotive ism, which is just the identity, or you can actually do something interesting to the graph.
43:13
So I'm not quite sure whether I've answered your question that there's another question here.
43:21
It's about time for us to stop.
43:25
But I feel the very something, obviously that makes it difficult to say, well, if you if you for the automotive ism, if you reordered the, you could.
43:27
The autumn always would correspond in if it was a non-trivial one, would correspond to reordering the rows and columns.
43:49
And if you got the same matrix that way, then that will be a sign that you had a non-trivial autumn organism.
43:56
So you could you could find it that way. I mean, I don't.
44:04
For humans, it's not so easy to sort of look at adjacency matrices and see these things basically.
44:08
So it's easier to look at diagrams, which is what I tend to do in these lectures.
44:12
But in these examples here, we could have written down the rather long, adjacency matrix and then we could have said,
44:17
well, if we if we swap the two in the six rows here or something like that and see what happens and things like that.
44:25
So there is something going on underneath which would be more like, well, how a computer would tackle the issue.
44:31
But yeah, question the. Sorry, could you speak a little bit louder, sorry.
44:38
Sorry, I still couldn't hear everything, but.
44:57
And one that you have drawn, you mean in principle, yes, you can put it on, you can put it on, it's time if you want.
45:05
Yep, sure. Yes, question. Yes.
45:14
Yes, I think I mean, assuming that you've labelled the nodes on the two graphs, and let's say probably, you know,
45:29
if I was giving you that question, I probably would have labelled the nodes just to mean that we all got the same kind of answers, basically.
45:36
But assuming that the nodes are labelled, then you can have a bi ejection on the node,
45:44
but it has to have this extra property that preserves the Connexions as defined.
45:50
Excuse me, do you mind answering questions I the.
45:57
I'm. How would you write that?
46:02
Well, I mean, various ways of writing it, but I mean, just list in two columns, I suppose one column is where the, you know,
46:08
if one maps the three that you just write it out in such a way or you can list it sort of half of
46:15
one equals three or something like that or some kind of just two columns or something of that sort.
46:19
Just any convenient notation. So now technically, we should talk about the arcs as well.
46:26
But in many cases, the arcs just follow from the binary mappings,
46:32
as in these rather simple examples here, until there's a question in the chance of having a look.
46:36
Difference in water, water and ice, the water is fish, I assume orgasms are a growth which contains the same information.
46:46
If you were asked. Well, I think that yes, basically.
46:55
But that is slightly to anticipate what you're handing in for the PMC.
47:02
So I'm right on feeling it's time to stop because you've got to be somewhere else.
47:11
I'm not quite sure what's happening next, but you're staying here, are you?
47:19
But someone else is coming in? Or you OK? So I think it's time for me to shut up, shop and let them take over.
47:24
So apologies about the slow start here, but it does seem to be quite an elaborate set up now,
47:31
and I think it's going to take me some time because anyone waiting outside anyone, they must know what they're doing.
47:37
But I'll get better as the weeks go on. I dare say it's getting this thing set up.
47:43
So thanks very much, everyone. I'm going to stop the recording at that point. To find out how to do that.
47:49
And thank you for all the questions coming online and keep the question what's coming in at some?
