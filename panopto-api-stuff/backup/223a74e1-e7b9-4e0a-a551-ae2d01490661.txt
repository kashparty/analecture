So now I want to show that Prem's algorithm is correct.
0:02
So that's the content of this theorem. Let Gibeah connected weighted graph.
0:07
Then Prem's algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree for G.
0:12
So let's say that G has N nodes. And let's give names to the trees that are constructed at each stage.
0:16
30 zero will be our initial tree with just the start node and no arcs.
0:24
And then the next form will be T1, etc. So Teekay plus one is got from Teekay by adding let's call it arc a sub K plus one and T sub K.
0:31
We'll have K plus one nodes in it because Ts zero has one node.
0:44
So there are N minus one stages because we've got N minus one node that needed to be
0:51
added and then T of N minus one will be the final tree returned by the algorithm.
0:55
So let's show by induction on K that each T K is a sub graph of a minimum spanning treaty brime of G.
1:05
And if you think about it, that will be enough to prove our result. Because then we will say that T of N minus one T.
1:14
S, then minus one is a sub graph of a minimum spanning tree.
1:22
But since it has N minus one arcs in it, then it must actually be spanning tree itself.
1:26
And therefore it is a minimum spending tree in itself. So.
1:32
As usual, the base case should be an easy case, so K equals zero two zero has one node and no arc.
1:38
So clearly, T zero is contained in any minimum spending tree of G.
1:46
Because he is just not a single note in it. So that's obvious.
1:53
So the induction step is the interesting bit. So let's assume that our induction hypothesis holds for Kay.
1:58
So we're assuming that T is a sub graph of T Brime.
2:06
Some minimum spending tree. T prime. Of G. So this is the situation we're at in Prem's algorithm.
2:11
We've got Teekay, which is the yellow region. And we've got the fringe, which is this region here, and we're going to add in RC a K plus one.
2:19
And so Y will be added to the tree. Why this fringe node Y?
2:35
Well, the easy case would be if a K plus one this R was already in T Brime,
2:40
then in that case it would be obviously true that Teekay plus one is a sub graph of T prime as well.
2:49
And so we would have verified the the K plus one we had have the property we need for K plus one.
2:56
But that might not be the case, may be a K plus one is not in the arcs of T prime.
3:05
Well but if you think about it, t crime is a spanning tree.
3:12
We have assumed that. So therefore there must be a path from X to Y within T prime.
3:16
So it's not this obvious path. The arc AK plus one.
3:23
But there must be a path from X to Y within T prime. So here this diagram shows that.
3:28
So this path here, the longer path here. This is within TI Prime.
3:34
The minimum spanning tree. But then you can see we've got a cycle here.
3:39
He has a cycle. OK. And well, so think about going the long way round the cycle from X to Y.
3:43
Well, then we must cross over from the yellow region into the fringe at some point.
3:53
So the first point where we cross from Teekay into the fringe.
4:00
B, this arc here going from X prime within the tree to Y prime in the fringe.
4:04
So this arc eh. Here like that. And then we carry on around to y like that.
4:11
OK. So what can we say about the relationship between A and well an A and AA plus one.
4:17
Well since they keep us warm was chosen to be the shortest. Then A cannot be any shorter than that one.
4:30
So let's form a new spanning tree.
4:38
T double prime from T prime. By removing arc.
4:43
Aye. And adding in a K plus once they're back to our diagram.
4:47
So we've taken out A from T prime which has sort of broken this cycle here.
4:52
But we still can get from X prime to Y prime. Because we're going to we're going to add in a K plus one here.
5:00
So we haven't we haven't actually. We've still got a path from X prime to Y prime within the new within our spanning tree
5:08
because we have replaced going directly from X prime to Y prime by going the long way round.
5:20
Sorry. Let's go back. Here we are. So we formed Teto Prime by removing A and adding a K plus one.
5:28
Well, since the algorithm chose AK Paswan,
5:37
rather than a we know that the weight of AK plus one is less the way to pay and therefore our new spanning tree,
5:39
Titova Prime has weight less than or equal to the original spanning, spanning tree.
5:47
Because we haven't made it any more weighty and therefore, in fact, a must be equal, of course.
5:53
So TDL Prime is, in fact, a minimum spanning tree. And, of course, the nice thing about you Prime is it's the same as prime,
6:02
apart from the fact that we've got a kapos wanted there, which is what we wanted.
6:09
And so therefore, Teekay plus one is a sub graph for T to whole prime as required.
6:14
And that completes the induction step. And now we can polish off the proof because T and minus one has N minus one
6:20
ARC's A. And minus one is a sub graph of some minimum spending tree T prime.
6:27
And all spanning trees for G have N minus one talks.
6:36
So it must be the case that T and minus one is actually equal to T prime and therefore T and minus one is an M s t as required for our proof.
6:39
So we can make some remarks on this proof, the induction hypothesis here,
6:51
we can regard as an invariant for all while they each time we go around the while loop.
6:57
We know that we have a minimum. We have got a sub graph of a minimum spanning tree.
7:03
Then we add an extra arc to it. And then.
7:13
But we we know that we at the end of doing the while loop, we still have a sub graph of the minimum spending tree, possibly a different one.
7:17
And so that's would that we relate star proof here to the methods that are covered for doing my loops in the reasoning about programmes course.
7:26
Second remark is that each Teekay constructed by Prem's algorithm is connected.
7:41
And the third remark is that each Teekay is a minimum spanning tree for the sum graph of G induced by its nodes, basically.
7:48
So if we just take the sum graph with nodes, the nodes of t.K and all the oxygen which join the nose together,
8:00
then Teekay is a minimum spending tree for that sub graph.
8:08
So these are interesting points, two and three.
8:14
But they I think the most interesting thing is that our proof did not actually require us to to use either two or three.
8:16
So we managed to get R. We managed to re-establish our invariant without using two or three.
8:24
But they are interesting properties that we could also approved by induction as we went along had we so decided to do.
