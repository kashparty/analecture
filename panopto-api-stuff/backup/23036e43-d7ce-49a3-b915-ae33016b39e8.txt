Welcome come back. In this little unit, we will be discussing why does induction hold?
0:02
Is it the sound principle to go with? And secondly, we will also be discussing out of cases where it doesn't hold.
0:08
Should we be careful when we are applied? I'm looking forward to discussing this with you on Tuesday.
0:16
Let's start with. Why does induction hold?
0:23
So the base case tells us that the property holds four zero, if we apply the inductive step, it will give us that.
0:29
It also holds for one if we apply the inductive step again.
0:36
It will tell us it hit the pause for two. Again, it holds four three.
0:40
Again, it holds four, four. And so on. And so on. So if we think that we have got.
0:46
We have got a line with numbers and the numbers are zero, one, two, three, and so on and so on.
0:55
And and plus one. Then.
1:04
Because of the base case, we know that it holds four zero and then we apply the inductive step here and we're not holes for one,
1:11
we applied to get any calls for two. We apply it again.
1:20
It calls for three and so on. And when we reach an. We apply it again and it holds four plus one.
1:24
So by applying the inductive, principally an infinite number of times, we know that the property holds for the into all the infinite natural numbers.
1:31
And here is a little cautionary tale. You might have come across this argument on Tuesday, we'd like to know how many of you know it already.
1:50
But for those who don't. Here is an assertion.
2:01
All people in a room have the same age. This is patently false assertion.
2:06
And what I do is I will show you a proof that this assertion holds.
2:14
So we define a property, be over the natural numbers.
2:23
And. P stands for everybody in a room with and people has the same age.
2:27
And if we prove that for all n p o then hold it, then we will have proven that that all people in the room have got the same age.
2:34
So let's see how that works in the base case. What we need to show is that everybody in a room with zero people has the same age.
2:44
And it's obvious if we have the room and there is nobody in the room, then everybody in the room has got the same age.
2:57
In the step, we will take an opportunity. Kay.
3:07
We will assume with inductive hypothesis that everybody in a room with KPP has
3:14
the same edge and we will show that to everybody in a room with Kate plus one,
3:20
people has got the same age. So how do we prove it?
3:24
We're taking home with keeping us one people and two arbitrary people.
3:29
A and B. Then we remove a and now deduction Hypothesises is a play company,
3:33
namely we have got a room with KPP and therefore everybody in that room will have the same age.
3:41
So that means everybody except for A has the same age.
3:51
Now we bring back a. And we removed B.
3:56
And by the same argument, induction hypothesis is applicable. Therefore all the people in the room except for B have the same age.
4:01
Therefore. A has got the same age as everybody except A and B and B has got the same age as every book we accept A.
4:09
Therefore, they have the same age. And therefore, everybody in the room has got the same age.
4:23
Is that surprising? Is that so? So the question is, is induction flawed or is it limited?
4:37
Is this a case where we could not have applied induction or did we make an error in proof?
4:46
I will let you think about this question and we will discuss it on Tuesday when we meet.
5:03
But in the meantime, what I would like to to stress is justify each step.
5:10
Make sure that each step in your proof makes sense. And then all is going to work when.
