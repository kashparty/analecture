Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova

All right, so hello and welcome to our second part of the six lecture instruction to go through our system.
0:01
So I was as I was just saying, we are now going to go through a Step-By-Step example of designing combinatorial digital circuit.
0:07
So the first thing we are going to have is a description of the problem that we need to solve or the kind of circuit that we need to implement.
0:18
So in first, informally, we could have a specific mission that is as follows.
0:27
Somebody as a client, let's say, tells us that they want us to build a material circuit with three inputs and one output input,
0:32
and B, are for data and C, is for control.
0:44
And the way in which they are used is that they want whatever the control beat is zero.
0:48
They want the result to be the result of ending A and B together.
0:56
And whatever the control B is one, they want the result to be the Oring, A and B.
1:02
And they won this result in circuit to be as small as possible.
1:10
So the thing that we're going to do first is formalise this specification,
1:19
so the first stage in this is going to be usually a funding can only go home or or equivalently to a stable.
1:27
And what we're going to do, first of all, just to help us to think about the problem is through some kind of block diagram.
1:39
So we have here a box, a black box that is implementing our.
1:47
Secret that we were just asked to implement and we have the two data inputs, the two bits, and then we have the third input, which is the control B,
1:52
C and one output, which is our and the way in which this black box on the left works is as it's written on this table, we have control.
2:05
There is zero or one and one control is zero hour.
2:16
We want it to be A and B and whatever control is one, we want to be A or B.
2:22
All right, so once we have this first date in the formal specification,
2:29
we are going to go and put it all together into a truth table simply by extending the formulas that we have here.
2:34
So we are going to have seed that can be either zero or one. So we have this with zero and six with one.
2:44
And then and then on each of these cases, the result of are is going to depend on the data inputs.
2:51
And so we have here all the combinations for A and B, and the result for each of these cases, depending on C, is going to be A and B,
3:01
which would be this case where C zero and we already know how to do that through a table of A and B, which would be this bit what we're here.
3:10
And then on the second case where C is one, we want A or B,
3:19
which would correspond to this and we already know the truth, how to build the truth table for A or B.
3:24
So now we have the truth table. And of course, as we just all we could do can only go for maximum form and that would be a possible result.
3:33
But remember that we want to have the smallest possible circuit that implements this problem.
3:45
So the next thing we are going to do is, of course, a corridor from the juice table.
3:52
So we're going to take that the table that we just got and use it to fill up the kernel map over here.
3:59
And then again, as we already know, we're going to circle all the ones and find the minimal equation,
4:06
because in this case, remember, when we circle once, it's because we are using terms and this has.
4:15
Minturn for. So once we have this, we already have a solution for our circuit.
4:22
Now, remember that what I said is that the economy is not perfect and the solution that it gives us is not necessarily the smallest one.
4:35
And if we look closely at the equation that we got from the granola,
4:43
there is one further factorisation possible in this case, which makes the equation even smaller.
4:47
And therefore, we can get this final circuit here that could be done as well as possible using
4:56
the technique from the table and then applying some additional simplifications,
5:03
using all the rules that we already know from the equation.
5:09
So remember that most of them are quite simple,
5:13
but there are some very cute ones like the Morgens Theorem that we have to remember and also how
5:18
the factories turns out that we always have to remember in order to do these simplifications.
5:24
So now, before we continue, let's do a very small problem, so here we have the same as before,
5:32
and now I would like you to try using maxims to find the minimum circuit starting from this chordoma.
5:42
So I will give, you know, a little bit of time. You can post a video and then we'll look at what the solution would be.
5:50
OK, so I hope that you with some pen and paper to look at the submission and of course, if we are using Maxime's here.
5:58
What we would take is circling this to zero over here, then we would circle these two because remember,
6:09
we are looking for zero because we are using max therms.
6:17
And then. We would take these two over here.
6:24
Wrapping around the table so we could have these three times that, as we saw before,
6:30
you already know how to get down into the boolean equation form using Moxon's.
6:37
So with this, we reached the end of this very short second part.
6:49
And what we are going to look at on the third and last part of this lecture is how
6:53
to do some further optimisations and circuits and how to go about testing them.
6:58
So with this, I will see you on the next part.
