So now I want to talk about planer graphs. Sometimes it's desirable to avoid ARC's crossing it a graph.
0:02
For instance, if we were engraving circuits on two microchips,
0:11
then obviously we can't have large arcs crossing because that would lead to sort of short circuits.
0:17
So in that case, we would have to avoid that either by redrawing the graph it hopefully or else more expensively to avoid a crossing,
0:25
we might have to have several layers in the chip to avoid the the undesirable crossings.
0:34
So let's define a graph to be plainer, if it can be drawn in the plane so that no arcs cross.
0:43
Notice I say can be drawn. So there is some way of drawing that graph so that no arcs cross.
0:50
So here's two examples on the left. We have what is actually a plane, a graph.
0:58
The cube graph. But notice there are arcs crossing, of course.
1:04
The way I've drawn it here. But if you think about rotating it in your mind, you'll be able to see.
1:08
I hope that it can actually be redrawn without any arcs crossing.
1:17
Or you can try moving one of the nodes like this one to Iraq, to the sort of outside the cube to get to prevent the arcs from crossing.
1:24
On the other hand, here's another graph. This is what's called K five, the complete graph on five nodes.
1:35
And, well, obviously, it's got plenty of arcs crossing. But actually, there is no way to redraw this graph without arcs crossing.
1:42
So. As I said, the queue graph is planer, and we can verify that by redrawing it as follows.
1:51
So you can see we're now sort of looking straight down the cube rather than from an angle.
1:58
We can remove some crossing's with K five,
2:04
but there's still one crossing left and trying to get rid of that one is just going to introduce further crossings, if you think about it.
2:08
Try it for yourself. So K five is not a plane.
2:16
A graph. A further example of a non-plan.
2:20
A graph is what's called K three three, which in the jargon is the complete bipartite graph on two sets of three nodes.
2:25
So that's the three nodes on the left and the three nodes on the right.
2:34
And then what we've got is notice there are no connexions between the blue circles and our part of the graph.
2:38
But they are just to show you the two parts of the two components of the bipartite graph.
2:44
You can see that there are no arcs within each of the two components within the blue circles.
2:50
But we have made it a complete graph in the sense that we've joined up every arc, every node on the left is joined to every node on the right.
2:56
And so that's the completeness here. And we again, if we try, we can remove plenty of crossings, but we can't remove.
3:08
We've still got one left no matter how we draw it as here.
3:17
So that, again, is a non in a graph. Well, how can we work out whether a graph is non played or not?
3:23
So an interesting fact you're right off Ski's Theorem from the 1930.
3:33
Is that any non-plan? A graph turns out to contain either K five,
3:37
the complete graph on five nodes or K three three as a sub graph in in a sense that I will now make it more precise.
3:44
So obviously it does contain K five or K three three, then it can't be a plane, a graph,
3:53
because just making it more complicated is not going to help us to get rid of the crossing involved in the K five or the K three three.
3:58
So the more interesting, the more interesting point is that any non-plan, a graph will contain those in some sense.
4:07
One of them at least. So let's define two graphs to be homier, morphic,
4:17
if they can both be obtained from the same graph by a series of simple operations
4:23
where we just replace an arc X Y by putting in an intermediate point,
4:28
said to get two arcs X said and said Y. So here is a blue graph in the middle.
4:33
And then we can get this one on the left by just putting an intermediate node on this arc here.
4:39
Well, we can get the one on the right by just putting an intermediate node on the diagonal arc.
4:47
So these two graphs, the red ones are homier, morphic.
4:52
According to this definition. So they they and they cost they're both derive from the blue graph.
4:56
So that's the definition of commy more fearsome. And Kotowski Theorem tells us that a graph is planer.
5:05
If and only if it does not contain a sub graph. Homier morphic to K five or K three three.
5:11
So it might not be K five or K three three exactly. But some sort of homier morphic version of one of those two graphs.
5:18
Well, as we've seen, it's not obvious whether a given graph is plainer,
5:30
particularly if it was a big graph with millions of nodes, then we would have lots of different ways of redrawing it.
5:35
And Kotowski Theorem does not give us an obvious way of deciding the issue either.
5:42
I mean, we might spot the copy of Cave five in there or K three three, but it's not so clear how to do that in a graph with millions of nodes.
5:48
But the surprising thing is that there is a linear time algorithm due to Hopcroft and Chargin 1976,
5:58
which does indeed tell us whether a graph is planer. And what do I mean by linear time here.
6:06
I mean Bigo of N plus M where N plus MEAC is a sort of measure of the size of the graph.
6:12
It's the number of nodes n n is the number of nodes sorry.
6:18
And M is the number of arcs. So this means in some way that we are dirty an algorithm which is linear in the size of the graph.
6:23
So from that point of view, testing whether a graph is planer turns out to be quite easy.
6:33
Easy in the sense of low complexity. Linear time. We can say is very low complexity.
6:38
Another interesting fact about planer graphs is that if a simple graph is planer,
6:45
then it can always be redrawn so that all arcs are straight lines which don't cross.
6:51
So if we go back to our cube graph here, this turned out to be planer and we managed to redraw it with only using straight lines.
6:56
So any plainer graph that simple, we can always get a drawing using only straight lines.
7:06
The final point we can make about planer graphs here is that any plane, a graph obviously splits the plane into regions which we can call faces.
7:18
So let's take our cube graph again as an example. It's got six faces.
7:28
Well, a cube obviously does have six faces in 3D,
7:33
but our plane graph Planer Cube graph has got six faces because we've got five interior faces and then we've got the whole outside world,
7:36
which we can count as another face as well. Which we might think of as being that the back of the cube, I suppose, in our example.
7:47
And so let's suppose that a graph has that's planer has got N nodes, A ARC's and F faces,
7:56
then Euler's formula says that F equals A minus N plus two for a connected plane.
8:06
A graph. And we can cheque that formula for the Cuba example.
8:12
There are six faces F equals six 12 Volks and eight nodes.
8:19
And indeed, we do verify that the formula works in this particular case.
