Date: 23/11/2021
I don't think should we protect anything?
0:03
Yeah. Yeah.
0:12
We don't have because we can't we can freeze people. Yeah, that's true.
0:15
Yeah.
0:24
Let me see what else the panel is about seven is was meant to be the displacement of citizens were fighting, mainly because they're not getting it.
0:24
Let's continue. OK.
0:41
And then same with Roger with a couple of months and then pretend to know something about yourself, which, you know, think about your job.
0:42
Would you do what you put on display at the same time?
1:02
You get that far right?
1:33
I'm really there's to be water anyway.
1:44
So everybody is one person, so everybody knows the difference between somebody who is an apologist for the whole weekend.
2:06
So it wasn't like all these other things.
2:39
Yeah, I don't think so.
2:57
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
3:12
I don't know what you said. You have worried about, you know?
3:20
Well, I think some people obviously much better than us.
3:40
I think what I do, what comes out of that wakes up over the last week of the election is like this issue becomes much more expensive.
4:04
So let's not forget that.
4:34
That's what I was trying to.
5:00
And this is going to be the speech.
5:12
I mean, there is just a simple going to be recorded and that's that's cool.
5:20
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5:38
Oh yeah, yeah, it's not.
6:48
Guys, guys, please please base out a little space around a 50 percent capacity, so one empty,
7:12
one empty, if we have a third, we're going to go to the other rooms when it's going to be streamed.
7:18
Please, space. So you know.
7:22
Yes, what would you do next? I mean, if we're gonna be okay with it?
7:30
Yeah, I like. Have.
7:46
President Bush. Well.
8:15
It was. Well.
8:39
Some people say they think the other room is just.
9:13
It's like. I feel sorry.
9:31
Simpson, a slightly more vicious spiral. I hope that.
9:37
We're going to put it all. It looked like.
10:02
And. That's.
11:01
Right. See?
12:19
How did questions get picked on? Is this something that's not like you might be, maybe you got something you want to look at,
13:24
someone that's like, you ask questions like this young man, I think it's going to cost you.
13:43
I think it's going to be something that.
14:00
Just to just started to feel Typekit wouldn't work that way.
14:42
Oh, that's right. All right.
15:17
All right. All right.
15:41
Give you this stuff like the five that's going or whatever to lessen the one.
15:52
I don't know. Like, it's usually here.
16:35
It just reminds me that perhaps you turn on the lights.
16:40
Yeah, it's not here. I get that right.
16:47
My name is lumpy. Yeah.
17:05
So that's what we're going to focus on.
17:17
And that's time I to ask you about what it's like to read also that young
17:22
people know that if we have the testimony of all these other stories as well,
17:40
it's not going to be like, Oh, well, how are you?
18:27
Hello. Hello. Hello.
18:50
If someone goes. OK, let's start.
18:58
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming here for an internship, one on one by a doctor.
19:09
So firstly, we can start with introduction. Maybe we can start with Sebastian from the far right.
19:13
Hello, Sebastian. So I know me.
19:21
I'm president of docs like this. You probably have the least experience of everybody here, but I guess the most expensive kind of start-up oriented.
19:25
I was around quite a lot of Start-Up accelerators and incubators in high school, then lost some unintended boys to be called TransferWise.
19:33
This big fintech start-up in the UK kind of really changing the way money transfer works.
19:40
So my input tonight will be mostly for you. I just stating kind of interning in start-ups and going to more Start-Up careers.
19:46
Then I work like a Big Tech company. Sebastian, so everybody, it's nice to see so many of you today.
19:53
My name is Ivan. I also studied computing here at Imperial for the immense degree.
20:02
So I graduated this year, so 2021. Before that, I did a placement at Citadel as a software engineer.
20:09
And then before that I worked also as an intern at JP Morgan and Medcraft.
20:17
So a little bit of finance and a little bit also of the Start-Up experience. And yeah, I'm excited to chat with you guys about things we want.
20:22
Hi, I'm Andy. I graduated the same year as one as of this year.
20:31
I'm currently a software engineer at Google and I have done two internships at Google.
20:36
I will be talking a bit more about the fighting side of things. Hi, I'm Rania.
20:41
I'm part of the committee, but I'm also panellists today. So I'm a third year student and student final year at Imperial Computing.
20:47
I did internship at Google for my first year and then second year I did in there.
20:56
So yeah, I think that's about it. And should we jump to the next section here, so maybe we can start with Andy first.
21:00
Firstly, when you did your internship at Google, you did it twice. What were you hoping to get out of your internships?
21:08
I think I wanted to get mostly software engineering experience and more sort of what it's like
21:16
to do software engineering in a company because it's very different from doing group projects,
21:22
which you guys might be aware of if you started doing Pinto's or Black next time, even even with the C C project as well.
21:25
Mainly because group projects,
21:34
it's a really great way to get that experience and sort of emulate what it's like to work in a big team and work towards a really big project.
21:35
But when it comes to a big company like Google, there's a lot more processes that you have to go through a lot more checks and just making
21:42
sure that your code is all working and not breaking anything because obviously in a company,
21:48
if you break things, it costs money, whereas if you break things, you lose a lot of marks.
21:54
Other than that and other things that I was looking forward to,
21:58
getting out of the internships was sort of more guidance on what life is like outside of Imperial basically,
22:01
and what career paths people have, because literally for many people, people going to so many different avenues.
22:09
I just want to figure out it's offer engineering was the correct one for me.
22:14
Yeah, I definitely really feel like in the end of the internship is to get you a job,
22:19
but you kind of want to learn a lot of experience there because it's so different
22:24
working with actual employees compared to team members who are students.
22:27
You learn a lot about the process. You learnt about what you like out of a job, what you don't like out of job.
22:32
So it's not about your credentials, but also fit for you to figure out which step you should take next.
22:37
Right? Can you tell us a bit about maybe about the project that you did there?
22:43
And then what specs did you enjoy or what but you don't like from your internship in Google?
22:47
Do you have a chance to indicate your interest or preference, maybe in Google?
22:53
And how did it translate to your full time experience? Yeah.
22:57
So with both of my internship projects, I did not have much choice.
23:00
I was just kind of put in in a team that I was semi interested in and just sort of told to do a project.
23:04
But I got really fortunate in that because the projects were really interesting and very interested me.
23:10
My placement project, in fact, is still active and very much open source and being used, so that was actually really cool to see.
23:15
Other than that like stuff that I've learnt in previous internships, I use some of the knowledge now currently in my day to day work.
23:22
But other than that, because it's a completely different team to the previous two teams that I was in.
23:28
It's just a whole new ecosystem to have to work with and familiarise yourself with,
23:33
which is quite cool in the end because it's a much bigger team than I'd ever worked with before.
23:38
Cool. I think you have a lot of team options in Google, actually.
23:44
When you're a full time right intern, you don't get as much. Yes, but you have a variation of experience being Google.
23:48
We just have big teams and a lot of teams. So how so you end up two times in 30 and Google and converting to full time?
23:56
Can you describe your journey? How did you learn an internship in Google, not application process, but maybe that you have insights beforehand?
24:05
Or just what was your journey to getting a job? Well, I actually applied for the step internship, which I think a lot of you might have applied for.
24:13
I think applications are still open. Definitely not a plug,
24:20
but that was the main thing because step felt right for me because I like a lot of experience when it came to software engineering,
24:24
because first year I didn't do anything except probably like teach programming to kids and do a few side projects.
24:31
So Step just felt like a really better fit than any of the software engineering roles that I applied for.
24:39
Also, because I was lacking experience, I did not get very many internship offers.
24:43
I got rejected from 56 companies. And secondly, when I was applying. So definitely keep that in mind, guys.
24:49
Just keep applying. You got that. Other than that, the journey was basically just to apply for Start-Up and then afterwards,
24:54
just work at it to get the next internship and then work your arse off on that to get the return off of it.
25:02
Because Google does offer that sort of escalator programme that once you're in, if you work really hard,
25:07
then they will do whatever it takes to try and keep you because you've proven yourself as an asset to them.
25:13
And that's the case with a lot of fine companies as well.
25:17
If you get in and you've you're doing a good job, which you probably are because your imperial students,
25:20
then they will do anything in their power to try and keep you. And that includes like, you know, you know, you know,
25:26
providing perks or whether it be sort of trying to figure out, what do you want to do alongside your degree?
25:33
Because a lot of people I know they do start their full time jobs whilst they're still in the degree.
25:37
That's quite rare to see, but they find companies really are flexible because they really want to make you happy because they want to keep you,
25:41
because everyone in this room honestly is an asset never like on the set of your skills, honestly, because you are worth so much in the industry.
25:49
Yes, that's a very important point. Everyone in this room is an asset. That's why I was very rich of.
25:57
Yeah. So thank you so much, Andy. But yeah, I agree. Definitely before that.
26:05
Did you have any insight events or maybe something that leads you to stop?
26:09
How did you know about step and. I applied for step because one of my friends sent me a message and said it was open,
26:13
but other than that, I had a friend who was in the year above who did stop and looked really cool.
26:20
It looked really fun and I was very much sort of inspired to sort of apply for that.
26:25
So I reached out to her. Application process and stuff like that.
26:29
I think that's the thing with a lot of fine internships at Imperial, especially,
26:34
it's like reaching out to a lot of third years or even fourth years just to figure out how to apply and what to really show off in your applications
26:37
and to sort of figure out what these companies are looking for in order to make sure that they pick you basically for the internship roles.
26:46
Yeah. So definitely like, you know, don't be afraid to reach out to third or fourth industry while you're even late sub or even mean Yvonne.
26:53
Because literally, like we're always happy to help and literally don't shy away from like asking for help when it comes to applications, right?
27:01
Yeah, definitely. Thank you so much. One last thing about the internship what was the best and worst thing about the internship at Google?
27:09
The best thing was being able to go into the office and get free food, you know?
27:18
But to be fair, that was pre-COVID, so that was something.
27:24
The worst thing was probably doing it remotely because of doing it remotely had its own set of challenges,
27:27
mainly not being able to communicate effectively with my manager and with the rest
27:34
of my team because time differences and people are online at different times.
27:39
Other than that, I did really enjoy my projects, though regardless. It's really nice to hear.
27:44
Yeah, so well, yeah, I can relate a lot about the stuff they teach us a lot.
27:49
It's just that internship. I can go into it. They want you to just learn, do you want to keep you as an asset?
27:54
They they're not expecting you to really work and contribute.
28:00
They're more like nurturing you or this is the Google culture or you want what you want you to come back.
28:03
So, yeah, that's really nice about this step in their career because I also had no confidence was my first time working in a big company,
28:09
and they really help you in that to gain your confidence, to step up for your full time.
28:15
I thought you were going to do next. Thank you so much.
28:21
Maybe we can mix well, more other questions after after I introduce Cobra for all the panellists.
28:25
Oh, I also want to note that we try to bring variation for our speakers.
28:33
And here is Google, which is part of FAANG.
28:37
So if you guys are interested in fine Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Google, it's quite similar to describe all in a big tech.
28:40
They usually have quite similar experience because they have large teams they have.
28:50
So the team usually takes care of a very specific project in the company.
28:57
The experience also quite the same work-life balance. And yeah, I think we can have more refined questions next.
29:03
But we are moving on to Avon, did whine to finance.
29:12
So even debt and still and also JP Morgan, which is finance also macro start-up.
29:15
So same question as you did a lot of internship and digital placement.
29:22
What were you getting to to fight? What were you hoping to get out of the internship and placements?
29:26
And yep, so a few things, most of which are similar also to A.
29:34
So the first is just that it's just something to do over the summer.
29:39
You've got a lot of time off and if you can find a project that is fun for you to work on.
29:42
I think this is a pretty fun way to spend the summer in a good way to get experience as well.
29:47
The second thing is as really software engineering experience in an industry setting.
29:50
So how can you do something at a at a high standard to make sure it's reliable?
29:56
It's easy to work on and also make sure that it's useful for other people because sometimes you make a course with project.
30:01
And then that said, it's kind of done and no one's ever really going to look at it again.
30:08
It's not really going to be useful, but in a company, you want to make sure that your projects kind of have a life to them, right?
30:12
They're involved and people can add to them easily, and they're always providing value to some other person or some other team.
30:18
So being able to work on projects like that, I think, was a good experience.
30:24
And thirdly, also to find out a little bit more about whether finances and social engineering finances for me.
30:29
So I would say that this is something that you guys are considering have some interest in.
30:36
The easiest way to find out if it's for you is do an internship. You have a lot of summer today, internships, right?
30:40
So just try it out is the best way to really immerse yourself in the subject and see this is something that you would want to work on in the future.
30:45
So I would say give it a go, and that is another thing you'll get out of it as well.
30:52
Yeah, I definitely agree. I feel like and you need to just work on the projects and you do it for the score.
30:56
Meanwhile, in work, you can really feel the impact. What are you really making in your full time job?
31:02
You work nine to five on it. So you want to make sure that you're actually like the fact that you're making the results.
31:07
And I feel like. Also, your dream company might not be your dream company,
31:13
sometimes for some people or you always want to go to fact or you always want to go to training and then when you go in
31:19
there or you find out things that you didn't know you didn't like and that helps you a lot and get a full time job.
31:23
The rightful will take up for you so you can enjoy the rest of your life. Moving on to the next question.
31:30
So what project to work hard on Super Bowl ads, TV or any company that you want to tell us that might be that will be interesting.
31:37
Yes. So most recently, had Citadel, I worked on a few projects.
31:44
The first thing to do is to give you one or two boot camp projects, which is a great idea.
31:47
So they give you very small projects to work on, which are still useful to some other team.
31:52
But they give you a chance to really explore and find out how well the systems of the company work without taking on too much at once.
31:57
And then the main project to work on was it was mainly to do with cloud computing and
32:05
making it easier to develop and debug and quite errors in cloud computing workflows.
32:11
So it's working a little bit on that,
32:18
and that was really fun to work on in a good way to kind of get exposure to a lot of different parts of the department that I was working on.
32:20
And yeah, it's something which ultimately is quite satisfying because you get to make life easier for developers and ask them,
32:28
Hey, you know, what do you have a problem when you're trying to debug this? And they're like, Yeah, well, this could be easier.
32:33
So to make that easier for them, that's a satisfying project to work on. And that was the main thing about Tron Citadel at J.P. Morgan also.
32:39
Well, there are many automating some things. So a lot of automation projects and then net craft.
32:48
I worked on scanning my repetitive things.
32:53
So, yeah, I think this is my takeaways try to work on as a diverse a set of projects as you can in your
32:57
internships to to get a bunch of experience and find out what you want to work on in the future.
33:02
Yeah, that sounds very technical. Actually, that made me curious.
33:09
So you learnt we had to learn a lot of, of course you learnt in computing in our major,
33:12
but did you get a tool to when you start your job, there's a lot of new skills that you need to pick up, right?
33:17
How did you pick that up? Because it sounds very specific, the one that you have to implement in your internships.
33:22
Yep. So this is a very good question. Internships like obviously, you get paid, but most of the value comes from learning, right?
33:28
So you want to pick an internship where you're going to learn a lot if that's why you're doing an internship in the first place.
33:34
And I think Citadel is a pretty good choice for that because they really invest a lot into you as interns so that you learn, right?
33:39
So they they have, you know, even several weeks sometimes of essentially workshops where you work in small
33:46
groups with a teacher who's able to teach you things in finance and also Python,
33:53
C++, things like that. So you can really learn a lot through workshops and also through working with your team.
33:59
One thing our team did, which was very good, is that we had these kinds of system design sessions where someone proposed system design idea.
34:06
And then we we all talk about the different pros and cons,
34:12
but that was one way to learn as well is just by really actively like often this time tempting.
34:13
We in our team meetings just kind of microphone off camera, go to sleep, eat some food.
34:19
But OK, fair enough. But if you want to make the most of that opportunity,
34:25
then try to think critically about what people are saying and ask yourself, Would I do it the same way?
34:30
Why or why not? And I think that's a good way to learn is just by being switched on in team meetings and thinking critically about what's been said.
34:35
OK. It's very interesting because, yes, reinterred you want to learn a lot of your day, right?
34:43
Because you want to prepare for your next job because you're not staying there for full time.
34:48
So you mentioned our experience. How did you read the policeman and also the internship?
34:53
What was the process or what was the insight that you had before you start? Yep.
34:59
So like, I applied for this job basically because of the Ducks mailing list.
35:04
So thank you to you guys. I keep an eye on those emails.
35:11
They're important. They can change your career. And and yeah, I would say that, you know, just, um yeah, I guess for for London internship,
35:14
the most important thing is to kind of plan your preparation a bit, right?
35:24
So make a list of things that you want to do, like specific actions you want to complete and deadlines for them as you're preparing, right?
35:28
So read this page to this page of this book or do this code and this one and this one and this one right?
35:38
And the easy. And because, you know, often that these interviews you think, OK, well, they can ask you anything.
35:45
So often it's a little bit daunting. But if you just write down what you want to do, then it's like, Yeah, this is kind of manageable.
35:51
I think I can do this. So I always say this most important thing. Obviously, though,
35:58
I would recommend that you look at the internship excuse for more detail and application things because I don't look at those and they look very good.
36:02
So take a look at them as well that you do like spring weeks, maybe Insight Week or any career events.
36:07
So I did week, I disagree with JP Morgan, that was very fun. They fly you to London and then they give you food and drink and accommodation for free.
36:16
So that is good. I'll see you learn some things. Fruit bearing fruit is the key in a company.
36:24
Google offered good central offer. JP Morgan overflew price free food.
36:31
OK. Yeah, I think we can move on to Sebastian next.
36:37
Maybe. OK, Sebastian,
36:41
you did an internship at a start-up and then you also did Start-Up Incubation and your high school Mary hoping to get out of your internship.
36:44
How does it help? Maybe because you're in third year? How does it help with finding placement, figuring out what you want to do next?
36:53
Yeah, I think it depends a lot.
37:00
So definitely my last internship was the case that it was OK.
37:04
Is this this fintech company that was really sort of getting a bit well known in the Start-Up World?
37:08
And it was it was just me being very curious about fintech, and I had a feeling that a lot of the fintech companies would be.
37:12
And I wanted to see, Is this actually true? Right? So got in the belly of the beast.
37:19
And actually, by the end of it, I did. I was quite firm that a company oriented I was was nobody else, but mostly jazz clubs.
37:23
So it was like, OK, probably Monzo, Revolut as my I've run a business for five years.
37:29
So I think if you have like a particular interest in the business and start, it is really,
37:34
really interesting because it's super hands on and they usually give you a lot of it's make it
37:37
very accessible to talk with very senior people and you're going to learn a lot about a business.
37:42
I think previously I did more like I worked at a kind of Irish company called Bitdefender,
37:47
and I did like a very sort of researching role R&D I was developing like explainable AI systems.
37:53
So I think that was a very different experience because of my interest in data science type stuff.
38:00
You can also ask me. It definitely requires to be like a particular type of person.
38:04
Yeah, yeah. I think your experience really differs from the other panellists because you went up to a start-up.
38:09
Meanwhile, big company like Uber, Morgan and Google has a more structured programme.
38:15
I feel like for internship, they have a programme manager and they really take care of the interns.
38:20
How was your experience, Start-Up as an intern? Do you get to contribute more or do you feel like you make more impact?
38:27
What was the pros that you think you will then get out of other companies?
38:32
Yeah, it's super hands-on, like, especially because Wyze works in a structure called autonomous teams,
38:36
which is invited by Spotify, where a particular team that is in charge of something.
38:44
So we were in charge of the referral programme, for instance,
38:48
if we were in charge that we made all of the decision around that there was no a master business plan and we are sort of working towards that goal.
38:51
Everything was in charge with our team. The team knew the customers. The team was collecting feedback for that particular feature and so on.
38:56
So then as an intern, obviously you come in and you take a project and you think it's super hands-on, like,
39:02
for instance, I yeah, towards the end of the internship, I was very close to breaking email referrals in production.
39:06
And that's like millions of customers are using them. So there's that.
39:11
But I think also, you know, this stuff like one of the sort of side things the team does is if you go to Wyze dot com,
39:16
you see this comparison table on the front page, which compares wise with other companies in terms of transfer prices.
39:22
I added a website powers when you bank.
39:28
In the first two weeks, I made a contribution on the main page of the company in the first two weeks of the company.
39:30
Right now, that's quite rare.
39:35
If you don't go like a big, big, like Big Tech company, so it's very, very hands on how about the social environment there?
39:36
Was it? Does it help you grow with the learnings? Steve, I mean, the steep learning curve might be steep because you're very hands on, right?
39:46
But was it supportive? Do you think you get enough help to grow?
39:55
How is it for you? Yeah, I think it was. Definitely. Yeah, they definitely.
39:59
So there was a size where you would you would just kind of where you had to depend. But in terms of, you know, like you,
40:04
you would not waste time because you don't know a particular thing that's specific for the company, like someone will help you.
40:09
It was like, You know, this thing you have, you need to work with this system you probably never heard of.
40:15
It might be an internal thing that's always going to support that. So I think support was good.
40:18
Even though other start-ups might not be as good, especially a lot of stuff is when it earlier.
40:22
You don't have a lot of tech on their own.
40:26
So there's a lot of document documentation out there, and you might have to think of quite a few things on your site.
40:28
Yes, the support was very good, and I think the learning curve is quite steep, but you get used to it.
40:33
It doesn't flatten. To be honest, but depending on your project, but you just kind of get used to it.
40:40
You're very hands on with your project. Is there a lot of independence like you to learn by your own?
40:46
You need to just pick up skills fast and scope your project.
40:51
Was it like that or? Yeah, it was.
40:54
You had to pick up things quite quickly, like it was stuff like I worked in Java and you know, most of you have done Java.
40:56
But then I've never done spring zero. Okay, I have to learn spring in like a couple of days, and spring is a very heavy framework.
41:04
Like there's a couple of core concepts, but then there's still so, so much magic underneath that you have to be aware of.
41:10
So stuff like I picked up, I think both spring and reaction, like 12 to 10 weeks working on different projects,
41:16
which is quite nice and does a lot of sort of concepts around system design,
41:23
nanoparticle figure, stuff like that, which was was quite quite interesting. Oh, that sounds very nice.
41:29
My question will be, are you returning to a start-up for your interstellar placement or are you thinking of something I do know to ask that question?
41:33
I mean, OK, so I'll say this. I. OK, so I don't know where I'll be in placement.
41:41
That's the short version.
41:49
The only reason why I got an offer from was no reason why I didn't come back was because it was everything was so good that it was like,
41:50
OK, I don't want to like, throw myself into this. Like, there's just so much out of that that I want to explore.
41:57
Like, for instance, you don't appreciate the yeah, just being able to deploy the millions of users like 30 minutes until you go to something like,
42:02
you know, like a bank or something where the risk tolerance is just so low.
42:09
And I think it is like a general tip. It is very good to go to different types of companies, right?
42:14
So people,
42:19
people on this panel provide different perspectives and you should aim to collect different perspectives as you go through your career even early on,
42:19
right? They're all very valuable. And they did. You forget to appreciate certain things if you don't, then try different kinds of companies.
42:26
That's true. Yeah, I think you'll be very lucky and hit it to go back to Google.
42:35
So. So we were really lucky to find, probably. And then we liked it and we go back.
42:41
But it's also fine. If you don't like the company and you want to try something else, you feel like, Oh, that's not for you to stick around.
42:45
No, that's why I get there early so that you can try out more companies and you can figure out what you like more.
42:52
Actually, I kind of forgot to ask about any more of your technical experience and Google.
42:59
Actually, how did you what was you mentioned at Start-Up nurtured you from the beginning?
43:04
Like you, they want you to learn. But how is this internship where you did?
43:10
They demanded to know a lot of stuff, or you had to pick it up on Google. I think with like any sort of internship project,
43:14
they kind of do throw you in the deep end and they just expect you to be able to take up a lot of independents learning on,
43:20
you know, whether it be the programming language or the frameworks that they use.
43:27
And, you know, just sort of ecosystem in general when it comes to step versus the actual placement internship that I did.
43:29
There's much more responsibility, but that meant that my code had a lot more impact than the one before.
43:37
Obviously, not as much impact as like SAP has probably had, like in a Start-Up,
43:42
which is usually the case in big companies because it's already so big.
43:46
So if you are the type of person that you'd like to see impact, you like to see your work make a difference,
43:51
then you know that's something to look into when it comes to like, you know, applying for internships and stuff.
43:56
Thank you so much. Yes, that's very helpful. I definitely agree.
44:03
You have to learn a lot of things, you know, internship and you're not expected to just intern salary because you're also working for the company.
44:06
So you need to be quite fast when you're working in a big company. OK?
44:16
I ask myself, or I can. I can ask. OK.
44:23
Sir, what's your name again? Hi, I'm Rania, I'm responsible, Eisen, I'm the one who tries to bring in money for Luxor.
44:31
OK, cool. So tell us a bit. You mentioned a little bit about your background. Tell us a bit about of your journey.
44:39
A bit more in depth. Maybe what you did at each company? Vaguely.
44:45
What I did in the company, I did a Google Stop internship like I was in my first year I did and Google London at and and then volunteer.
44:49
I work as a forward deployed engineer and then I didn't want I didn't work at a software engineering role.
44:59
So 44 engineers more about where you engage with the client more.
45:07
You just go for the problem and you transfer into technical problems and solve it with beta.
45:10
And yeah, that's what I worked on. How's that different from a consultant?
45:16
Oh, how is that different from a consultant? Because definitely you go more into the technical stuff I quoted.
45:21
I did a lot of the programming itself. I work as a student consultant before a student consultant.
45:26
You kind of does research on data. You kind of just make presentations.
45:31
Meanwhile, punters more like you go hands on as an engineer or as an engineer, I can solve your problem this way this ABC.
45:37
Which one will make more benefit for you? Which one will solve your problem with the best part?
45:45
Maybe it's not that good because it might impact other pipelines.
45:50
Stuff like that. So you got into both parties.
45:54
That's why I decided to go into that role specifically and intern and volunteer, because in Google, I o was a software engineering intern.
45:57
Basically stop. But I felt like I wanted to make more impact, more engagement with client,
46:03
more soft skills, because that's the kind of skills that I'm actually looking into.
46:09
So that's why, for me, that was like the right role. So onto your pan-Indian because it made us more relevant because more recent,
46:13
I distinctly so I know that I talk to you, and by the end of it, you liked it.
46:22
But I distinctly remember that couple a couple of weeks and I talked to you and you said the company hates you.
46:26
Yeah. So you said something like that that your your supervisor abandoned.
46:32
You know that. Oh, wait, no, it's OK. So so yeah, tell me about that.
46:37
OK. They did abandon me. I got a full time offer. So I think it's more like in ponds here.
46:42
They're quite a small company for the amount of projects that they have. They work on interesting projects that we're not promoting.
46:49
But yeah, you can come to find here.
46:56
But they have a lot of interesting projects, but they don't have much employee, so they put a lot of responsibilities to every person and employee.
46:58
We work a lot not going to lie. I work from nine to eight or seven for an intern.
47:07
They expect me to be a full timer. Basically, I was handling a pipeline, my my own.
47:14
I meet the client. And yeah, you're just quiet.
47:17
There's not a lot of guidance, I would say, because they're expecting you to contribute as much as a full time.
47:22
As my experience as an intern there. So, yeah, that's was what I meant.
47:29
It's the expect for you to have hyper independence. It might.
47:33
It's good.
47:37
But the good thing for some people, I have spoken to a few of my interactions and they really like it because, oh, I get to make choices on my own.
47:37
I get to handle live abroad. Meanwhile, maybe I prefer something more structured.
47:44
So yeah, that's just preference. Personal preference, right?
47:48
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So talented.
47:52
Yes, very sort of client focussed company. Well, it depends from client.
47:55
Did you get any you get to pick where you were working for basically? Or is this all kind of done by them while they recruiting you?
48:00
When I was an intern, they did not. I did not get to pick, but I did say, Oh, what kind of work I like?
48:07
And they try to match it up with me.
48:13
The projects, and I know quite a few interns indicated that, oh, they went away to the government and they put them in government.
48:14
That's an example. As for full time, I also can't choose my first project, but after that, it's very flexible to move and volunteer.
48:21
So the way it works, the work, you just work on a project for six months, minimum, not minimum, and then you can change.
48:29
You can just talk to someone, Oh, what project are you going? Are you working on?
48:36
Who are you working with? Well, I'm interested. Can I move and make a move?
48:39
So it's pretty flexible on what and they work on different fields like commercial.
48:43
They were on government. They were defence, security, anything pharmacy.
48:48
Yeah, so right. And you were working quite long hours.
48:52
How is the social life? The contact? Your social life is actually great there, the people, because we don't have a lot of people in the company.
48:56
I kind of know a lot of people because people stay in the office. A lot I don't know back, but yeah, we socialise a lot.
49:02
We meet at a lunch, dinner and companies. Great office. Great.
49:09
So yeah, I find some really nice friends there for my internship.
49:13
It was in person as well. So yeah, thank you for asking me a question.
49:18
Sure. Will want to do a Q&A? Yeah, let's go. Yeah, one of the questions first was amazing.
49:23
Well, all of the questions are basically addressed to everybody, and we'll see which people from Japan want to pick them up first.
49:30
Maybe we can start with the one, the first one, how you can make up for it like previous experience, honestly.
49:37
Anyone want to take this question? Yeah, I had zero experience when I was applying to Google.
49:45
The one way to actually make up for it is side projects that can be like something very simple to like.
49:52
You know, building your own website or like cutting a Tic TAC toe game in Python.
49:58
There's something to show that you have added experience like about computing aside
50:02
from everything you're doing in computing when it also comes to experience as well.
50:07
The the group projects that you do actually do count as previous experiences because the way Imperial
50:12
focuses on you doing the group project is very similar to how you kind of work in industry.
50:19
So that's something that a lot of people do put on their CV. So you definitely see a lot of pin toss and back again.
50:24
Side projects are really good, even hackathon projects as well that you can put on on there.
50:29
Even if they don't work, you can still put them on that because you can talk a lot about the ideas and how it failed.
50:34
Because literally, the more you do, the more experience you get, the more you can talk about things.
50:38
Thank you. Does anyone want to add anything about like experience?
50:47
But yes, school projects, our school projects, our heart.
50:54
Its heart. So put it up in your CV and just do more side projects.
50:59
Maybe you can also do more support.
51:04
I see one thing as I know that definitely some people have been more hesitant to put stuff like You think, OK, well, everybody has done Pintos.
51:05
That is true. It is less good than putting your own personal project. But then the, you know, comparing to other unis printers is really hard core.
51:14
Like, I guess you might not get too much ahead with other people from Imperial,
51:21
but compared to other unis, of course, it's like a different level than what the playing with.
51:27
Oh, just to clarify, a is an operating system module group project, which you you will get in the first term of second year.
51:33
So for the first year, who are wondering and it's really hard? OK, yeah, maybe we can move on to the next question.
51:40
So what internships? What you recommend for first years?
51:49
Yep. OK, so good question. Two things to say here first. Firstly, I remind Annette Craft I would really recommend it is really good fun.
51:55
So very chill environment. It's like it's quite fast paced, but you also have a lot of responsibility as well.
52:03
And I would say that, yeah, it's a good place to learn, and it's kind of it's quite friendly.
52:11
And, you know, people there will be keen to help you out and everyone that's just really enthusiastic about what they did.
52:18
So it's just a really nice way to spend the summer.
52:23
The second thing I'd say, though, is that like you should, regardless of where you wants to internships, you just apply to a bunch of companies.
52:26
Even if you don't want to work, then first, you always apply. Right?
52:31
Because think of it this way, a year from now, are you going to regret having applied somewhere?
52:35
Probably not, right?
52:41
If it didn't work out, OK, then where are you going to regret not having experience applying somewhere much more likely to regret that, right?
52:42
So apply now and save yourself regret next year.
52:49
You'll get some experience about what it's like to do interviews what you know, you'll get better at preparing for interviews and that kind of thing.
52:51
So, yeah, I enjoyed that craft. If you like cybersecurity, that might be for you as well.
52:59
And secondly, just apply to a bunch of places because it's always a good experience.
53:04
And one regret application is also it's a lot of skills, but also a lot of luck.
53:08
Right? Does everyone agree? Yeah, I know one time one more thing.
53:16
Oh, you want to go? OK. So I think and I think I think running my I agree with this.
53:22
So one thing which is kind of interesting, especially if you're non UK, I feel like when you move to any country,
53:27
you lose a lot of connexions, but you might still have connexions back home. So what a first year was.
53:32
I mean, my internship at Bitdefender was like the amount of R&D in that industry.
53:37
If you would just not get that as a as an intern first year anywhere.
53:42
And I think using whatever Connexions you might have from the country you left using using whatever connexion it was,
53:47
yes, anyway, using whatever Connexions you might have.
53:59
I know Ronnie did some stuff with Indonesia is actually very useful.
54:05
You have your basically that's your unfair advantage a lot of other people might not have and and do leverage that.
54:10
Yeah, for a traditional studios. I'm from Indonesia, actually. Google Step is my third internship.
54:16
I did two previous internship before that. So, yeah, me myself, I don't really like doing projects by my own.
54:21
I kind of want to really feel, what's the impact? I want to get paid. So I try to do it ships more, I think, on the luck aspect as well.
54:26
One way to really have luck on your favour is again, like asking seniors for help with applications because like they can give you,
54:35
they can give like so much advice that's like really like anybody, but also like you can hear from them firsthand what their experience is like.
54:43
So you can figure out yourself if this is a company that you want to apply for.
54:49
So again, yeah, like, look, definitely, but you can't sway that in your favour, and that's why everyone's here.
54:54
Hopefully they're listening to us, the seniors you Typekit. But yeah, are you guys can also after even after the session,
55:00
like feel free to ask us anything about advice, tips, referrals, maybe actually one more thing.
55:08
We're going to have an event on this in February. Ish is Europe's.
55:15
For those we don't know, I think Europe is undergraduate research opportunity project,
55:20
something where you're basically an intern into a research group in the department and the way you get them.
55:24
Long story short is you usually have to email lecturers who you're interested in and interested in the research.
55:31
You have to look them up with day and then they might offer Europes or not depends and just email like and people you think are interesting.
55:36
And then you go to Europe, it's paid and it's pretty good fun. You get to know quite a lot about research side of things.
55:45
So if you're wondering what you should do and not, that's a very. Very nice and true.
55:50
I think a lot of my friends as well in past year, they did Europe's instead of internships because internships,
55:54
applications closed like around winter and obviously for an first year, you don't really know anything about it, so you don't apply.
55:59
But Europe's definitely it's a really good place to start.
56:05
Also, like if you want to see if you want to go more into the academia side of things because it can be interesting.
56:07
Definitely, Europe is an option, but we'll have a separate session for Europe, right?
56:14
Yeah. OK, so moving on to the next question.
56:19
How do you negotiate salaries in the case where you have? Where are you, where you have multiple offers?
56:27
I'm guessing business for internships because there's one on one. Does anyone want to take the question?
56:36
Yeah. OK, so good question. So the thing I'd recommend here is that so this was the case for me with Citadel.
56:41
So if you get like, OK, I would say what's important here is to like, be friends with your recruiter.
56:48
Right? My recruiter was great. She was super helpful, very friendly, and honesty kind of felt like she was on my side, right?
56:57
So be upfront with them. Be honest with them. If you have deadlines for other offers, tell your recruiter and just be like, just be honest with them.
57:03
Just say, Look, I really like the company. Really like a team. I have this other deadline and this other offer.
57:10
Here's what they're offering. Can you help me out here, right? So if you're just honest with them, OK, don't say like that.
57:15
But then I don't say OK, Google or look at the cracking the coding interview, but for the exact wording for how to send this.
57:21
But it's fake. It essentially is. Can you help me out here?
57:30
And yeah, so I would say number one, to be honest and upfront with your recruiter and be friends with them, and they will help you out.
57:34
So did you negotiate for your internship salary? So the way?
57:42
Well, like, I talked to them a little bit about it, but the way it works is that as a good starting point,
57:47
it basically is like if you just tell them the other office you have and how much they are,
57:55
then they will like do what's in their power, usually to match them if they actually want you on their team.
57:59
Sometimes it might not work out, but I would say that yet like, if you do that,
58:06
you probably wouldn't really mean to negotiate that much because like the office usually speak for themselves.
58:10
And then if you just match, that's and that's fine and you win all amazing questions, you would have eaten pizza and pizza.
58:15
Yeah, you got it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's the format.
58:29
Yeah, the format of this is basically we're going to stick around like this kind of more formal format and like for like 10, 15 minutes.
58:33
And then we're just going to hang around with you guys with pizza until you until you all leave.
58:38
But I think I think another thing is with the negotiating is that it done is actually quite hard to negotiate money,
58:44
but you can negotiate time quite well and you basically can say you can just fast track me.
58:51
And it's also very good if you have another offer. And it's also like, let's say, competitive place.
58:58
Like I have an offer at Facebook, just sort of like I have an offer here. What are you going to do about it?
59:02
And they know if you are sort of both, if if you know how to get get your point across, they're going to move faster with you,
59:07
which is the most important thing, probably because you want to get done with internships, applications and interviews ASAP.
59:16
Every single time. Also, when it comes to negotiating, is the worst they can do is say no.
59:22
So like even if you don't have a competing offer, you can just ask, like, can I just have more like, I know it's a bit like upfront to say,
59:30
but if you do what it correctly, you know, they might surprise you,
59:37
especially when it comes to like more of the mid size of the start-up sized company.
59:41
If they have the budget, then they will stretch because your imperial like that has a lot of value to it.
59:44
I spoke sorry, I was asking you, you negotiate for Google.
59:52
I tried to negotiate stuff because I did have a competing offer that was much, much higher.
59:59
But they said, you know, because in the cracking the coding interview, it says, always negotiate.
1:00:04
What they can do is say no, and that's it. Nice. But I think what they can do is say no.
1:00:10
Obviously, at the end, they couldn't negotiate because they have to pay everyone on the same bond.
1:00:16
And there's very little leeway on each payment because obviously the higher you get in the employment sort of socket,
1:00:20
the more you can negotiate because the bands have larger range.
1:00:27
So obviously in that instance, they could negotiate but say, like, well, my full time like if I did have a confusing offer,
1:00:30
then they probably would have budged a bit on a lot of the compensation stuff.
1:00:37
But for internships like, yeah, they can budge if they want to, but if they can't,
1:00:42
then they will tell you that their hands are tied and they will be very honest about it.
1:00:46
Is there a case where they actually have a bandwidth to X to bump up your offer, but they just say you can't?
1:00:51
Isn't it? Does that not happen a lot? No, I mean, like at the end of the day, like.
1:00:58
At the end of the day, from what I've known from people getting different salaries across different universities and different countries of origin,
1:01:07
imperial students get the highest bond when it comes to like the bond, like you get, you are on the higher end.
1:01:14
So which is why we are asking for more is very rare to get more because they're already giving you the highest that they have.
1:01:20
This is especially true when it comes to like mid-sized companies because they know your
1:01:26
wealth and you're probably getting paid a lot more than someone from like Sheffield. Maybe.
1:01:30
But this I saw a picture question, but yeah, we got ignored efforts to do you want to do it?
1:01:39
Dismiss completely the first question. No, it's not really nepotism.
1:01:52
If it's not working and if you're asking for referrals, if that's what I will say here, I'm yes.
1:01:58
I think networking is very useful. One thing I'd say, as well as like the Congress, if that is also true so that, you know,
1:02:06
if you're applying to company and you don't know anyone there, don't be intimidated. Apply anyway, right from my personal space.
1:02:11
When I applied to Citadel, I knew zero, zilch. People there at the company, I knew very little about it at all.
1:02:16
And as far as I understand, I was the only imperial intern in that particular year to engender.
1:02:21
So I would say that it's if you can use it, that's great.
1:02:25
It's very valuable. You should make the most of it. But don't stress or feel like you have should have imposter syndrome or something.
1:02:31
But just because you don't know that many people there. Another note on the nepotism aspect with the documents that you run,
1:02:37
you usually get a lot of people of contact coming in from those companies that they're applying for, and they're really, really good to reach out to.
1:02:44
One of my friends who applied to Facebook and his CV got rejected. He actually came to the Facebook event and reached out to the recruiter,
1:02:51
and she asked to send her CV and again, and guess why he's doing a full time at Facebook.
1:02:59
So literally, like the Docs organiser, you have all the points of contact, whether it be seniors, recruiters,
1:03:04
even literally like even just asking about the opportunities they are more likely to give you more information than you intended.
1:03:09
And that's a really, really good asset to make use of, especially your time here. So I sure want to add he has a great personal experience.
1:03:16
I have a point on networking, though, is that I know networking seems very unfair and like referrals seems kind of kind of weird,
1:03:23
but I know you all think you're special, you know, really?
1:03:30
And the fact that someone from the company can vouch for you is really important because otherwise it's like,
1:03:35
does this massive people who are all I mean,
1:03:40
there's a high degree of similarity because you tend to look at you guys all tend to think of the people got into some companies.
1:03:44
I think a bit about the people who nearly go over and then get in like the people who got rejected.
1:03:49
There's just so many of them who are so close and so similar to the person who got that position.
1:03:54
And this sort of aspect with someone being able to say, Yeah, this person's OK is very important.
1:03:59
And I think also, yeah, basically the bigger the company.
1:04:03
And it does depend, but the bigger the company, the less referral matter because they have more people and so on.
1:04:06
But in a very small company, profiles can be like game changing.
1:04:11
I know with Google specifically, a lot of people started complaining about the reform process because it doesn't do anything, but it really matters.
1:04:15
And asking for CFOs, by the way, from people, just ask them.
1:04:23
They I know if you know this, but they get money. If you get in like this, you wonder if people.
1:04:26
Right, so ask us for a referral, is that what you're implying? Okay, the next question are here you patient there?
1:04:34
Well, short of it. OK? Is it true that some companies blacklist you if you fail to get in one year?
1:04:46
OK? The only reason companies would blacklist you is if you say yes to an offer and then you say no after you've signed the contract
1:04:58
because a contract is binding and you have to honour that contract on both ends from the companies and then from your end.
1:05:05
That's the only time I've ever heard of some being blacklisted.
1:05:11
But when it comes to internships, they're not going to blacklist you like it's an internship.
1:05:13
It's not that deep. It's like. Yeah. But again, it is.
1:05:18
It is more about just being kind and respectful. And again, if you're disrespectful or if your CV has, you know, something weird.
1:05:22
And I only say that because one of my friends apply to bloom by going to CV had some really bad words, and he did not realise when he said that.
1:05:30
But other than that, you're very like, you're not going to get blacklisted for just applying and not getting it.
1:05:36
Like just just use common sense. Just, you know, be respectful, be kind and, you know, any sort of things they say, honour it.
1:05:43
I'm just very much like, if you sign anything, just know that you have to honour what you signed and to really,
1:05:50
really read through what you signed before you choose to dishonour and break the contract and stuff.
1:05:56
Yeah, I think I think if I say, I think there's definitely a thing of the art of of rejecting an offer like that, even if you sign the contract,
1:06:02
if you're careful and you're not, you know, a complete arsehole about it, it's it's kind of OK, depends on how you do it.
1:06:11
And also, some people kind of worry that they might get blacklisted if they get an offer and rejected again.
1:06:20
It depends a how you do it. I think there are some companies who sometimes do that, but for the most part,
1:06:26
it's it's quite quite sure just don't don't, you know, don't reject like an offer a month before the job starts.
1:06:31
That's a very safe way of getting blacklisted.
1:06:36
But, you know, going back to the question, I don't think you will get blacklisted from applying and getting rejected right now.
1:06:40
Yes. So, yeah, don't be afraid to apply. You can always reapply.
1:06:46
I also know someone who applied and reapplied and got a job afterwards.
1:06:51
Same comedy, but your next question does your nationality affect what type of job or project you can apply to,
1:06:55
especially in defence, security or related industries? From what I know from personal experience, GC HQ is like one of the main offenders of this.
1:07:04
If you're not a British citizen and if, like your, I think both your parents are naturalised or British, then they're very unlikely to take you.
1:07:14
Because GC HQ sets the government one for cybersecurity British, CIA, British, NSA and CIA.
1:07:21
That's one that's like one of the main companies I know of when it comes to docs not taking sponsorship from companies.
1:07:28
They try very hard to go for the companies that don't discriminate based on, you know,
1:07:35
where you're from or like, you know what, considering what like nationality and stuff or,
1:07:39
you know, views on stuff like that, because at the end of the day, you know,
1:07:43
we want everyone here to be able to apply to all the companies that are sponsoring docs.
1:07:48
I would say that is not directly nationality, but like, yeah, for those of you who need visas,
1:07:54
be a bit careful because certain companies will ask you if you need a visa and they literally might have like a statement says if they said yes,
1:08:00
automatic reject. So like, look out for the companies that are known to sponsor visas if you need one after you graduate and so on.
1:08:07
And be very careful about that, right? Yeah.
1:08:15
About security and whether you're going on that because there were a lot on security and defence and yeah, nationality does impact.
1:08:19
You need to be British to be work or to work on a certain government. You you want to work for a company.
1:08:27
You care, you need to be British. If you own a government, yes, you have to be a U.S. citizen.
1:08:32
So that's why I'm kind of restricted because I'm Indonesian. Uh, I think that's a question.
1:08:36
But other than that, I don't know security or defence. I don't think they don't.
1:08:42
They're not supposed to discriminate.
1:08:46
Discriminate is it's better to work on multiple smaller projects or one big project for gaining experience for CV, even me.
1:08:47
Yep. So I would recommend one big project over many small projects.
1:08:58
And the reason for this is that I mean, OK, recruiters are like, OK, this might be controversial,
1:09:01
but the reason I would make this recommendation is because it's a very limited time.
1:09:08
And if you have like five different projects, they're probably not going to spend time looking at.
1:09:12
Each of them are going to look at one or two and think, OK, these are OK projects, which if you have one like really one or two really big,
1:09:15
really good projects, you have a really nice demo on your website and you can show that and you're going to be impressed.
1:09:22
That, I think matters a lot. So I would say, like prioritise quality over quantity for projects to include, bring your CV the power.
1:09:27
The ones I don't like when you say big or small, just like sort of size of code base or size of buckets like that is important.
1:09:33
But I mean, I think whatever species to demonstrate that also matters a lot.
1:09:39
So pick projects which have a nice demo and which will impress people if they take a look.
1:09:44
So yeah, I think definitely quality is very important because in their reviews,
1:09:50
they don't ask you how many projects have you had, but how many different kinds?
1:09:56
What companies say more about what's your most impactful project?
1:10:00
What's your biggest project? What do you learn out of it?
1:10:03
They work the big and you need to emphasise just on that one project, and that would be good for the recruiter.
1:10:05
Next question Do you recommend writing a cover letter, which we should we take one more question, then we will wrap it up.
1:10:11
OK, sure. There's one question that answer mentioned there.
1:10:17
Do you recommend writing a cover that there when applying for stuff as it says there's no need to own the application?
1:10:20
This one is very short, I think. I think like I there wasn't really a cover letter section, but it was kind of more like mini essays.
1:10:26
So we had to do more of them, but they had only so like, is there anything that you want to tell us, right?
1:10:35
Did you say that? And I didn't specify a few things because I was a fresher student.
1:10:42
And I just say explaining because fresh air, I was very early.
1:10:48
I just got into university, but it's not necessary. And I know the recruiter say if there is, the cover letter is optional, they just don't look it.
1:10:52
I think we're very fortunate in software engineering a lot of applications.
1:11:02
If it's an optional cover letter, then you can't get away with not writing it because at the end of the day,
1:11:06
they're going to look at more on your CV and all of the projects that you're doing because you
1:11:11
can't you can't talk about that in a letter because the cover letter you talking more about like,
1:11:13
please give me a job. I am independent. I am resilient. Yeah, I want to basically put in the point about jobs in general.
1:11:19
If you wrote cover letter, I know things are a bit different in finance companies.
1:11:27
Oh, I did not have to write a cover letter for Citadel.
1:11:33
It depends a lot. But like a lot of companies, yeah,
1:11:37
they they they want you to do that because you need it to be motivated to what did you write a letter for JP Morgan?
1:11:39
Yeah, I think I read something. Yeah, yeah, I had lots of banks are basically no cover.
1:11:48
No, I'll take the sheet of paper.
1:11:52
Yes. I see a lot of questions about applications, the interview also, we already have the internship one on every key.
1:11:58
Right, distributed the internship internship at a cute document is really we, so we distribute it around.
1:12:09
If anybody doesn't know anything about it, just come to me and I'll give you.
1:12:16
The link is meant to basically summarise a lot of the questions everybody has and
1:12:19
be this kind of written document you can always go through in your own time.
1:12:24
And also that's going to be sort out every year and we're going to updated as we get feedback for it.
1:12:28
We'll take one more question mark and I think we can wrap up.
1:12:35
And if anybody has like pressing questions, just come come to us after what is going to be all around here.
1:12:38
We have a lot of interesting questions here, a lot and lots of questions that I would like and we will like to address.
1:12:43
But unfortunately, we're coming to the pizza side, I guess. Sorry, can I just put the hands up at a vegan, please?
1:12:49
OK, yeah. OK, good vegan. One one almost one.
1:12:56
Yes. Two. If you could close it anyway.
1:13:01
Thank you so much. How many of you in here vegan?
1:13:07
Wow, you had a vegan, please?
1:13:14
Thank you. Was a make. Could we for.
1:13:19
