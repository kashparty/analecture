So we want to identify problems in ENPI which are unlikely to be in pain.
0:03
These are the hard problems in ENPI. So let's use our notion of reduction to try and get at these problems.
0:10
So we'll define a decision problem D to be enpi hard if for all problems.
0:19
D priming enpi we have D prime reduces to D.
0:25
So D lives above all the problems in n p.
0:29
So if we draw a diagram then we can draw.
0:34
Here is our class and pay.
0:40
Like that, I'll draw it like like semicircles downwards, closed, and we've got some other problem, which we say is enpi hard.
0:43
This problem D and what that means is that if we take any other problem, any problem within ENPI, then that problem reduces to D.
0:53
So D lies above all the problems in ENPI in terms of difficulty.
1:05
When I'm drawing a difficulty going up the Y axis,
1:11
here we go and notice that we're not saying the deal itself belongs to n p in the definition of ENPI hardness.
1:15
They could be harder. So we could have a problem here. That's far too hard.
1:25
This problem d might be much harder than any problem living within n p it might be sort of exponentially time,
1:30
exponential time, difficult, or it might even be undecidable, which is something that will be discussed in the second year.
1:38
Lecture's undesirability. Came.
1:45
But what we can't say about ENPI hard problems is that if DNP hard and D reduces to D prime, then D Prime is also enpi hard.
1:50
So we draw a diagram here. I have to change that.
1:59
Let's change that to the double prime here.
2:03
So D is above every problem within ENPI. But let's say that we have D prime here which reduce the D.
2:08
He reduces to D prime. So this problem is just harder than D.
2:14
Well then clearly D is above everything and enpi then D prime must be as well.
2:19
That's just a consequence of the transitivity of the Lessner equals.
2:23
Okay, well, now we can define the famous N.P. complete class.
2:31
We'll say that a decision problem is ENPI complete or NPC for short.
2:35
If D is in ENPI and D enpi heart.
2:40
So the NDP. Complete problems, all the hardest problems in ENPI, so if we change on diagram here a bit,
2:45
then let's stroll the the the set of NDP hard problems and let's try it with this upwards facing semicircle like that.
2:53
So this will be ENPI or odd. And if it intersects with ENPI than any problem inside here, a problem here, would they?
3:04
These are the ENPI complete problems. It's in this region of intersection between the green and the blue like that.
3:17
So there is a would be enpi complete problems.
3:24
So there is a promise that set up at the top of ENPI because they're above in difficulty, everything within ENPI.
3:27
So that's the definition of an MP complete problem. And.
3:36
Well, it's not clear from the definition that these enpi complete problems should exist.
3:42
Why should ENPI heart problems exist? Could the really be a single problem that is harder than everything within ENPI?
3:47
I mean, we've got potentially infinitely many different problems in ENPI.
3:54
Why should something be harder than all of them?
3:59
And even more remarkably, why should that be something that is harder than everything an MP and actually lives in ENPI itself?
4:01
It might be that you need to get right up to the some very high level of complexity before you can get a problem,
4:09
which is, as it were, which is harder than everything within NDP.
4:15
But remarkably enough, it was shown independently by Kocan Levin in 1971 that there are NDP complete problems.
4:20
And the first one to be shown to be ENPI complete is the sad problem, satisfied ability for propositional logic.
4:30
And the proof of that involves Turing machines.
4:38
And so it's beyond the scope of these lectures.
4:42
But once we've proved that, then we can show that many other problems are enpi complete by leveraging or bootstrapping from the Cook Lhevinne theorem.
4:46
So how can we show that another problem is enpi complete?
4:59
Well, we rather than doing it directly using Turing machines, as we would have to do for set, we can use our notion of reduction as follows.
5:04
So we have this what I'm calling a method here to show that D and be complete.
5:14
We show that it's CNN P. Obviously that is needed.
5:20
And we show that D prime reduces to D for some known and complete problem.
5:25
So let's have a diagram. Perhaps if I read your best, let's redraw our class of and P serves for that.
5:31
So here is an P k.
5:44
And then here is the class, the NDP hard part of NDP is in here.
5:48
So this is in P complete is up at the top of NDP.
5:55
This is O blue area is NDP.
6:00
And so what we've got is we've got some known NDP complete problems here, like for instance that we know is NDP complete by the Cook Lhevinne Theorem.
6:03
And we've got some new and we've got some other existing problem that's NDP complete D Prime is in the method.
6:14
And then we've got this problem that we don't know about, which is D.
6:22
So if we can, first of all, show that D belongs to NVP, which is obviously needed, and then to show the ENPI hardness,
6:27
we can show that D Prime, which we know to be ENPI hard or Empey complete reduces to D.
6:36
Then that will tell us that D already is also enpi hard and that is just a simple consequence.
6:43
The method follows obviously from what we've already said, which is that the NPR problem is all closed upwards.
6:50
This green area is closed upwards. So that's what we have to do.
6:56
Well, the first part here is normally pretty easy to show that the problem is in ENPI.
7:02
We've already done a few examples and there are some more in the exercises.
7:06
And the second part involves us thinking about some kind of way of connecting the two problems by reduction.
7:12
And that is a bit harder to do. OK, well, let's take as an example, Hamiltonian path.
7:18
Well, we have already seen that Hamiltonian path belongs to ENPI by guessing and verifying in polynomial time.
7:26
So we know that he belongs to ENPI. Let's write in Hamiltonian Path.
7:36
Yes, we are. You know, it belongs to ENPI. We need to show that it's ENPI complete.
7:42
We need to reduce some known and complete problem to Hamiltonian path.
7:50
Well, the only one we know at the moment is sad. That's the only one we've got from the truck LEVIEN Theorem.
7:55
We will have more. But that's the only one we've got at the moment.
8:01
So what we if we can show that SSAT reduces to Hamiltonian path, then we can conclude that Hamiltonian path is ENPI complete.
8:04
And it turns out that it is indeed possible to show that Sapt reduces Tamil Ternium path.
8:14
But it's quite a long and complicated reduction.
8:19
So I'm going to admit from these lectures.
8:24
But supposing we can show that, then you can see by our method that we have the two ingredients we want.
8:27
We've got the fact that Hamiltonian path is enpi by just guessing the Hamiltonian path and verifying the tattoos on Amul time.
8:34
And then we've got this reduction from the known enpi complete problem to the one that we want to show is ENPI complete the Hamiltonian path.
8:43
So the conclusion, if we did indeed do all this work, would be the Hamiltonian parties enpi complete.
8:52
So we now have a second ENPI complete problem. Okay, so.
8:59
I said that what we are trying to do is to identify problems that are intractable
9:12
and we're doing that by identifying the problems which are hard within ENPI,
9:18
the ones which are up at the top of ENPI, and we can make that precise in this proposition here.
9:23
So let's suppose that P is not equal to ENPI, which is normally believed then if a problem D is in ENPI hard, then it's not in P.
9:32
So let's try and prove that. I think another diagram might help, but it's much the same as the ones we've got already.
9:45
So let's. Drool here, we've got P.
9:53
And here we've got ENPI. And then we've got ENPI Hard and which.
10:01
Something like this with SAT, maybe in the intersection here.
10:12
OK. I like that as an MP. Complete problem. And so the green area is MP hard, right, as well.
10:18
OK. What we want to show is that ENPI heart does not intersect with P.
10:30
So if you show that a problem is ENPI complete, then then it must be intractable.
10:36
In other words, not in P. Well, the proof is very simple. So assume that P is not equal to ENPI and assume that DNP hard.
10:42
Suppose for contradiction that D was in P then we'll show that enpi is contained in P.
10:53
So take D prime in an P. We want to show that it's also in P.
11:01
To show this inclusion. Well what can we say.
11:07
D is in is enpi hard. So by definition of empey hard d prime reduces to D.
11:12
K. And so therefore D prime is in P.
11:19
Why is that. Because D is in P. We've assumed and P is down with closed under reduction so D Prime is in P.
11:27
So we've shown that NPC is contained in P. But we know the P is included in ENPI.
11:35
And therefore we have shown the P equals ENPI, which contradicts our assumption.
11:43
So therefore R we have a contradiction. So therefore D cannot be in P, which is what we want to show.
11:50
Okay, so, um. If we can show that a problem is in NDP complete, then we know it's intractable.
11:59
Assuming that P is not equal to NDP as is generally believed, and that gives us this diagram.
12:09
Of ENPI. So we've got all three regions here. We've got PDU attractable region down here.
12:18
And then we've got the NDP hard part of NDP and always the NDP complete problems up at the top.
12:26
And if P is not equal to MP, then what we've shown is that there's an empty intersection between the two.
12:33
So proving that something is empey complete is a proof that it is intractable.
12:39
And of course if B equals NDP, then everything would collapse together.
12:46
These three classes would just be the same, in fact.
12:51
Well, the interesting point from this diagram is that you've now obviously got a region in between and you might wonder what is in that region.
12:55
Well, it has been proved that if he is not equal to NDP, then there are problems in this intermediate region.
13:04
This is actually called NDP Intermediate, this middle region.
13:11
It's not so clear about real life problems that we're interested in because the problem that was created in the proof of
13:15
that theorem is are all the sort of theoretical thing that you're not that interested in except for proving the theorem.
13:22
But there are thoughts that there could be there could be problems in this intermediate region, such as a graph isomorphic.
13:29
Some would be a problem that some people think can be in this intermediate region,
13:38
because we know that it's in Empy, but we don't know that it's ENPI complete or that it's empty.
13:43
So therefore, it's reasonable to conjecture that it's in the intermediate region in the middle here.
13:49
