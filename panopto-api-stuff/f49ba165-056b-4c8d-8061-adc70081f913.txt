Category: COMP 1st Year General
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 20/10/2021
Hello and welcome. My name is Richard Carruthers and I'm the deputy director of the Forest Service here
0:01
at Imperial College London and careers consultant for the Department of Computing.
0:06
You'll see me several times as you progress to your degree programme. But for now,
0:11
you're probably wondering why this Chris talk right at the start of your studies
0:15
and you're probably thinking it's way too soon to think about graduation and jobs.
0:19
Well, you're sort of right,
0:23
but internships and research projects will soon be opening their applications and these opportunities can pave the way to your future career.
0:25
So over the next few minutes, I'm going to briefly explain what's on offer to you from the charisms.
0:33
Firstly, our website contains a huge amount of information to help you identify career plans, gain experience and construct effective applications,
0:41
we can help you find opportunities, network with employers and previous graduates and explore further study routes at master's or PhD level.
0:50
Our website is also the entry point to the jobs life portal and jobs.
0:58
Life enables you to book events at appointments and search for relevant vacancies or reach out to mentors.
1:02
I'd strongly recommend that you set up and customise your jobs life profile to control the notifications and event invites that you'll receive.
1:08
You can also opt in to various newsletters, subscriptions and keep up to date with information, events and the occasional competition to.
1:16
We're connected to over six thousand employees, run a range of engagement events throughout the year,
1:26
our biggest events, the career fairs, which attract several thousand students,
1:32
are often term fairs will take place online to minimise the risk of spreading covid-19 while using technologies to
1:36
ensure you still have the opportunity to learn about internships and projects available to you as a first year student.
1:42
While it's not ideal, it does help to protect you, my team and visitors to campus.
1:49
And we'll be reviewing the potential to host spring and summer events in person.
1:54
The autumn term as details on the slide, but it's also worth checking jobs,
1:59
life to find the details of a range of company presentations that you can book to attend.
2:03
Where possible, we will record the presentations, but only when we've been given consent by the presenter.
2:08
So please never assume that we'll have a copy on file. As well as our employer engagement events, we run a central series of seminars and workshops,
2:13
these focus on exploring career areas and technical parts of applications like mastering CV,
2:24
constructing effective cover letter, acing online application and assessment tests, and performing well into the sessions also range in length.
2:30
So if you're pressed for time, you can attend a short session and essential.
2:39
Or if you want more detail and an opportunity to get interactive, you can book a longer session lap.
2:43
All these events are advertised on bookable through jobs like.
2:49
Jobs, life is also used to want more appointments, a team of professionally qualified and experienced staff for information,
2:55
advice, guidance to help you explore career options and develop skills to secure internships or placements.
3:02
We're currently offering a mix of face to face and on campus appointments and online appointments.
3:08
Using mux of teams,
3:13
you can book an appointment one working day in advance and use it to discuss anything careers related from checking application documents,
3:15
discussing interview performance or seeking career inspiration. Appointments last twenty five minutes and one working day from 7:00 a.m.,
3:22
you'll probably find that we're really busy at the start of the autumn term is our final year.
3:32
Students have a lot of application deadlines in October and early November.
3:36
She may want to wait a few weeks and then you'll find it much easier to get an appointment later in the term.
3:40
So, yes, it is very early in your degree for Chris talk, but Chris is a marathon, not a sprint.
3:47
And as the story goes, the tortoise beat the hare. So being prepared and persevering can lead to success.
3:53
I'd like to wrap up this session by highlighting a few additional resources that may be of interest to you,
4:00
the sometimes a bit hidden and imperils colossal website.
4:06
You may have encountered the welcome to Imperial Web page mobile app in various emails, if you've not had a look,
4:11
it's worth visiting to learn about the support available to you while you're studying here.
4:17
There's also a series of online events taking place over the coming weeks to introduce you to key teams and staff.
4:22
Welcome to Imperial Links after many useful resources, and one of them is the imperial success God,
4:30
this is crammed full of useful hints and tips to help you study effectively and to meet deadlines.
4:36
You've also probably heard of Imperial Horizons, which is a series of free supplementary courses available to you as a student,
4:44
you might want to learn a foreign language to internationalise your career potential,
4:51
explore ethical issues facing the future of humanity, or take some creative course content exploring things like science fiction.
4:55
And alongside imperial horizons, I think one of the best resources of Imperial's website is your full and free access to LinkedIn,
5:03
learning where you can boost your knowledge and learn new skills alongside your main studies.
5:11
You might supplement your degree by learning a new coding language or maybe explore
5:16
business concepts with an entrepreneurial course during one of the vacation periods.
5:20
And finally, it's not all about academic studies,
5:26
that theory being involved in extracurricular activities will help you make new friends ways to relax.
5:30
And it looks good on your CV as it shows you took full advantage of a university education.
5:35
The Imperial College Union Welcome Fair is one of the biggest events, the twenty twenty one welcome season.
5:41
And it's your chance to meet representatives from the three hundred and eighty club societies and projects.
5:46
So make sure you check it out.
5:51
So I talked for long enough, but hopefully you've going to brief insight into what career service can do to support you during your time in peril.
5:55
