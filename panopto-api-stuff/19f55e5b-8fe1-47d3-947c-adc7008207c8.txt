Title: Wellbeing Adviser - Introduction to Student Welfare and Support
Category: COMP 1st Year General
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 20/10/2021
Hi, my name is Caroline Gilchrist, and I am the student wellbeing advisor in the Department of Computing.
0:03
Before I go any further, I just want to apologise for what happened in yesterday's session,
0:09
the session on Monday afternoon, my computer completely crashed. And by the time I was able to get it up and running again, the session was over.
0:13
So I'm recording it now. And I do hope you will have a chance to watch this presentation.
0:20
I'm just going to switch my come off to minimise the risk of anything further going wrong in the presentation today.
0:27
So what I'm going to be covering today,
0:36
I'm first going to talk a little bit about some of the transitions that you might be experiencing as you begin your undergraduate studies.
0:39
I'm going to look at some health and wellbeing issues and some techniques briefly for building resilience.
0:45
I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about homesickness and some tips about what you can do if that's something you're experiencing.
0:53
And finally, a little bit about where you can find support. So for many of you, this will be your first experience at university.
0:59
It may also be your first experience of independent living.
1:09
And you're probably going to experience a number of transitions at this time, of course, that are going to be academic transitions,
1:13
because obviously studying at university is quite different to what you may be used to studying in the past.
1:20
There's a lot more autonomy. The workload is different, the pace is different, and I'm not going to go into that too much.
1:28
But all I want to say is that while some people might make this transition very seamlessly, it might take a bit longer.
1:35
And if you do find yourself struggling, it will please do get in touch. Your personal tutor is there to help you, the senior tutor as well.
1:42
I'm also here. To support you, it's also a time of financial transition for many people,
1:49
it's going to be the first time that you will be managing your own budget, thinking about your income and expenditure.
1:59
And again, I'm not going to elaborate on that too much.
2:05
I'm just going to say that it is a good idea to try and take a little bit of time at the start of term to work out your budget,
2:07
because you will find that you're going to get busy quite quickly and it's quite easy for things to spiral out of control.
2:15
We do have financial support mechanisms in place if you do find yourself in trouble.
2:22
So if that does happen, try not to get too overwhelmed and to come forward and ask for some help.
2:27
It's also a time of social transitions, obviously, for many people. This is a could be a new city.
2:34
It might be a new country. And for many people, you're going to be making new connexions and experiencing new and different living arrangements.
2:40
For some people, this can be a cause of a bit of anxiety because people might be worried that they're not going to make friends,
2:50
they're not going to find people with similar interests or who are like minded.
2:57
And I just wanted to reassure you that in a survey,
3:01
more than half of students actually found it easier to make friends that I had expected and to remember that you are all in the same position here.
3:04
And I'm just going to finally talk a little bit about personal transitions for most people.
3:12
University is about more than just studying and learning the subject matter for your degree.
3:20
It's also about learning about who you are. And being at university can provide you with lots of opportunities to explore new
3:26
experiences and try on different identities and see what fits and what doesn't.
3:33
And you've probably realised by now that who you are is not a static and unchanging thing,
3:39
but it's something that continues to evolve and change throughout life.
3:47
And the other thing to mention about identity, of course,
3:53
is that you have many different identities once you're not just one thing, but a combination of many different things.
3:55
And these integrate and emerge from your past experience, your personal strengths and weaknesses, your preferences, upbringing, gender, ethnicity.
4:03
So many different factors contribute towards this.
4:14
It's important to realise that this is changing and it will continue to change throughout your life.
4:18
And I think it's important to consider how understanding your identity can help you to understand how you experience stress,
4:25
why you react the way you do in certain situations, and what you might need in terms of support.
4:33
So, again,
4:39
if you are finding any of this challenging and that's perfectly understandable at this stage in life and you do want to come and have a chat about it,
4:40
then please do.
4:48
And I've got a couple of little quotes here around identity that I like, the first one is from Dr. Seuss, the author of The Cat in the Hat,
4:52
and he says, Be who you are and say what you feel because those women don't matter and those who matter don't mind.
5:00
And I really like the second one as well from Oscar Wilde yourself. Everyone else is already taken.
5:06
And I'll just let you read that third one. Yourself.
5:12
So just a couple of things about health and well-being that have probably already been covered.
5:25
One really important thing is that you register with the GP. We do have a health service here at Imperial.
5:30
You don't have to live near the campus to register with them, although you don't have to register with the Imperial Health Service.
5:36
You can register with something that's more local to where you're living if you want to. But they do have.
5:42
Quite a lot of resources, including some counselling and mental health support, independent of the college's counselling service.
5:50
Another important thing is to disclose any pre-existing conditions you have.
5:57
This could be disabilities, long term physical or mental health conditions, learning difficulties, anything at all.
6:00
And it is really important to come forward so that we can make sure you get the right support and seek reasonable adjustments.
6:07
Is much better to do this early on, because if you leave it very late in the run up to assessments and exams,
6:13
it can be more difficult to get these things put into place.
6:19
Even if you think it's something that isn't that significant or you don't think it would count
6:23
or be classed as eligible for any of this type of support is still worth coming forward.
6:27
And do you discuss any concerns at all that you have with us? I want to talk a little bit now about mental health.
6:31
The most recent statistics that I've been able to find is from 2015.
6:42
But in a survey from 2015, 78 percent of students reported experiencing a mental health issue, which is obviously quite a lot.
6:48
And I imagine with the recent pandemic and lockdown that may even have increased,
6:56
I think it's very important to distinguish and to highlight the difference between what is mental illness and what is mental health.
7:03
Mental health is something that we all have just lack of physical health.
7:11
It's what we consider to be a continuum. So sometimes your health is going to be better than at other times.
7:15
We all have periods in life when we feel when we feel down, when we feel challenged and when our mental health is affected.
7:21
That doesn't necessarily mean that we have a mental illness.
7:29
And on the other hand, people who do have diagnoses of mental illness will also have fluctuations in that condition.
7:33
So there may be periods, even long periods of time when they can be.
7:39
Relatively mentally, quite well, and other periods when the mental illness will be will be more evident and will present complications for them.
7:46
So it's important it's important to bear that in mind, to make the kind of support that you can get from me,
7:56
from the senior teacher, from your personal tutor and other college services is discrete and it is confidential and it's important.
8:03
And I'll talk a little bit more about exactly my role towards the end.
8:11
But it's also important to bear in mind that the support is that not just for people who are in crisis,
8:16
that you don't have to reach Crisis Point will be having some kind of breakdown to come forward,
8:23
even if it's just something really small or even if you're worried about something spiralling or getting worse.
8:28
Or it might even be a practical thing that you're concerned about.
8:35
You want some support with such as sleep hygiene or diet and exercise, then please just do come forward.
8:38
And and if there's anything that I can't help you with or whoever you speak to can't help you with,
8:45
what they will do is help you to find the right person or the right service that will be able to give you that support.
8:53
Moving on, obviously, it's really important, but any time in life that but this time of year, you're studying your students.
9:03
Do you think about looking after your well-being? And this will help you over the course of your studies to build resilience.
9:11
So self care is very important.
9:16
And one of the frameworks that you'll probably hear me going on about quite a bit is this one, which is the five ways to well-being.
9:18
This is an evidence, research based framework that's used by a lot of health and wellbeing organisations, including the NHS.
9:26
And basically the idea is that if people have these different elements in their lives, this will contribute to their mental health and wellbeing.
9:33
Now, it's not a one size fits all thing. It's a matter of people working out which things within each of these five areas works best for them.
9:42
And again, it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to do all of these things in equal measure.
9:52
Again, it's just about working out what's right for you, but basically going from left to right.
9:57
These things are one of the things is to keep learning.
10:03
Obviously, you're going to be doing lots of learning here at university, but it doesn't just mean academic learning.
10:08
Obviously, there are other things as well that you might find rewarding to learn, such as, say, new skills, new sports, languages, anything at all.
10:13
The second one is to connect and connect with people. And that's very important, to avoid isolation and loneliness,
10:23
and also because connecting with other people has been shown to improve our mental wellbeing,
10:30
especially if we're talking through issues and problems that we have.
10:36
So obviously, you can connect with your peers here, and I hope you will.
10:40
I hope during this welcome week you'll have a chance to go to welcome fare and find out about some of the many
10:44
clubs and societies that are on offer where you'll be able to find people who share similar interests to you.
10:50
And obviously, you can stay in touch with with people from home, with family and friends and so on as well.
10:56
The next one is take notice, which is also sometimes called mindfulness,
11:03
and this is really about being aware of what's going on in the moment, taking stock of your thoughts, your feelings, your body and soul.
11:07
On. Mindfulness can help people to enjoy life more,
11:16
and it can help people to understand themselves better and positively change the way that people feel about life and how they approach challenges.
11:23
I'm hoping later on in the year to do a workshop about that.
11:30
So you look out for that, if that's something that interests you. And another aspect of the five ways to wellbeing is giving.
11:33
Research suggests the act of giving in kindness can help improve your mental wellbeing.
11:42
And these can be small acts of kindness towards other people or larger ones, such as volunteering in the local community.
11:47
And then finally, we have to be active. Keep moving.
11:55
So being physically active causes chemical changes in the brain, which can help to positively change your mood.
11:59
Now, this doesn't mean that you have to go and join a sports team or the gym. That's not for everyone, for example.
12:05
That absolutely doesn't work for me. But it is a matter of just making sure that you have physical activity in your diet.
12:10
Could be going for a walk, going for a swim. But do try to avoid sitting down, especially in front of a screen for long hours every day,
12:17
because that will ultimately have an impact on your mental well-being.
12:25
OK, so moving on from there, I'm just going to talk a little bit about homesickness.
12:31
This is something that not everyone is going to experience, but many, if you will.
12:36
And it's a perfectly normal and understandable response to change.
12:42
And for many people, it can feel like a loss or a bit like grieving.
12:47
And I think it's really important here to highlight that it's not a weakness at all.
12:53
It's a very common and normal response, not just for students, but for anybody who's experiencing any big change.
12:58
And some people take longer to settle in than others. It may not be immediate.
13:05
A lot of people experience kind of a honeymoon period before they experience homesickness.
13:12
Some people won't experience it at all and it does usually resolve itself over time.
13:17
So you will find that things will get easier as time wears on.
13:22
But again, if this is something that you finding really challenging, then please do come and have a chat about it.
13:26
I've just got some tips here as well of things that you can do if you're feeling homesick, make a real feel as much like home as possible.
13:33
Try joining societies to meet new people, explore your new surroundings.
13:42
I mean, London, if you're not familiar with London, it's an absolutely fantastic city.
13:47
There's loads to offer. And the imperial campus is actually a really fabulous part of the city with loads going on.
13:51
They do take some time to to familiarise yourself with it home, but not too often.
13:57
That's very important. So obviously, it's important to keep in contact with friends and family from back home, but try to resist, if you can,
14:04
ringing every day, because that can sometimes sort of exacerbate feelings of homesickness, make a scrapbook or memory board.
14:10
I remember when I was at university, I had a big corkboard full of photos with people from back home.
14:21
And I found that actually really comforting to have.
14:26
And of course, reaching them structure can help you feel more secure as well as to try and stick to that.
14:30
And that can also have lots of other benefits as well, for example, for your sleep hygiene, for your study practises and so on.
14:36
So that's a good thing to do anyway.
14:43
And of course, talk to others about how you feel you're not alone and you will find that there are many of your peers who are experiencing it as well.
14:45
And most importantly, and not just to do with homesickness, but really about anything that you might be experiencing at this time.
14:52
Don't be hard on yourself, OK? Feeling homesick is natural.
14:58
It's very common. OK, so finally, I'm just going to move on to talk a little bit about some of the support that's available for you here at Imperial,
15:02
we've mentioned personal tutors and the senior tutor. I am in the department.
15:13
I'm solely full time in the Department of Computing. So I'm there Monday to Friday, usually 9:00 to 5:00, although that can be a bit of flexibility.
15:19
With that, I can offer you one to one appointment.
15:26
I will be on campus some days a week, but I can be fairly flexible about that if you prefer to meet face to face.
15:30
And I do have my own private room where we have these meetings can take place.
15:36
Otherwise I can meet you online. You can see my email address here and also on the Department of Computing website,
15:41
you'll find my contact details and also a link where you can book appointments directly as well.
15:48
I mentioned earlier as well that I will be carrying out workshops throughout the year.
15:54
So do look out for those you will find of publicised when those are and what the content is going to be.
15:58
And if you are interested, then please do sign up.
16:04
You've probably already heard about most of these other services that the student supports are in the student hub,
16:08
the Imperial Success Guide, we've already discussed the health centre.
16:15
Imperial has its own free student counselling and mental health advice service.
16:20
These are this is run by professional counselling counsellors and therapists.
16:24
And it's free for all students. You don't need to be referred.
16:31
You can contact them directly yourself. There's usually a bit of a wait, possibly a few weeks,
16:35
but they will offer you a series of sessions and they have a lot of other resources as well that you might like to have a look at on their website.
16:41
The Disability Advisory Service is where you would go to disclose any disabilities
16:49
or long term health conditions that are affecting your your studies.
16:53
And you can get in touch with Thomas Lancaster, who is the department's dedicated disability officer.
16:57
We also have chaplaincy and international student support.
17:05
And this is not an exhaustive list. There's actually a wealth of support options available internally here and also other external services.
17:09
If you go on the Department of Computing website and look under current students,
17:18
you will find a well-being section, which is where you'll find my contact details.
17:23
There's also a ton of resources on their internal and external resources.
17:29
There are websites where you can get information about mental health and wellbeing podcasts, apps that you can use on your phone.
17:34
So there's plenty there.
17:42
But if you need help with if there's anything you can't find or you need help accessing anything at all, then please just get in touch.
17:43
So that basically brings me to the end. I wish you all the very best with your studies at Imperial.
17:51
It's important to say that both myself and the teaching team want you to succeed and thrive here,
17:59
and we are here to support you at any time when you need it. Thank you.
18:05
