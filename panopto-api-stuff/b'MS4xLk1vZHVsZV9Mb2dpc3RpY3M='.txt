Title: 1.1.Module_Logistics
Category: COMP40017 - Linear Algebra (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
Hello, everyone, and welcome to this module. Com four zero zero one seven linear algebra.
0:01
My name is geotag and I am your instructor for this module, for the star.
0:08
A little bit about myself. I joined as a teaching fellow not so long ago, only 15 months ago, I competed right after completing my PhD.
0:15
I've done a PhD in computer science focussed on natural language processing.
0:26
And prior to that, I have done a Masters in artificial intelligence.
0:33
And I have a background in mathematics, I've done an undergraduate in mathematics,
0:39
and I was also a part of the Indian National Mathematics Olympiad team.
0:44
I'm originally from India, which is why I have this Indian accent.
0:51
I hope it is. It doesn't form of communication barrier, and I hope we can communicate more efficiently.
0:56
In my current role as a teaching fellow, I will be teaching mat modules that are required for computing and artificial intelligence.
1:06
For instance, I am teaching linear algebra to the first year students and I am teaching probability and statistics to the second year students.
1:16
Also, I am assisting. I was assisting Dr. Paul Buildcon for the calculus module.
1:29
And regarding research, my focus is on various topics in natural language processing.
1:39
Before we begin, let's talk about module logistics. So unlike in calculus where you had like lectures,
1:48
this time we will have what is called flipped teaching with pre-recorded lectures and live junior sessions.
1:57
So the flip teaching will have four components. The pre-recorded videos are not calling it lectures.
2:06
And I'll explain why. So it will have pre-recorded videos and live hybrid interactive Q&A sessions
2:13
and MMD sessions and course works as usual late last night and office hours,
2:24
which is something different.
2:30
So in pre-recorded videos, I will be recording videos on individual topics, and these videos may last for five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
2:34
They may not stretch for an entire hour. They are focussed on a specific topic that is being covered.
2:45
And as a result of which you will see these videos have a modular structure,
2:55
it's not it won't be titled lecture one lecture to lecture three and so on.
3:00
It will be Dyker. We media one on Richter's video, two on matrices videos, 10 or 12 on eigenvalues.
3:04
We do 15, 30 or whatever on singular value decomposition.
3:19
Things like that.
3:26
And I will be publishing these videos every week whenever I finished recording a video, I just published it on Panopto and I'll share a link on and.
3:29
Now coming to the part of the flip eating the living index, where you will be meeting me in person and interacting with me.
3:40
Those are the Q&A sessions that will take place on Mondays and Wednesdays every week.
3:50
And. Usually the the discussion in those sessions will be around videos that were published in the previous week.
3:57
That is because it. Once I had published videos, you will take some time to go through them.
4:10
Yeah, that would be the the main structure of the Q&A sessions,
4:19
will the discussion in the Q&A sessions will revolve around videos published in the previous week.
4:23
And in those Q&A sessions, if you run out of questions.
4:30
Then we will have. Ivan, I will be solving problems for you on the whiteboard.
4:36
So, yeah, it will be more problems, it will be it's it's more like a question and answer problem solving session.
4:47
Now, considering the size of the cohort and the available capacity of our lecture theatres.
4:57
I have decided to split you into two groups with groups, with first names,
5:07
starting with alphabets between Angel and the second group with first names starting with Alphabet between M and Z.
5:13
The first group to attend the Q&A sessions on Mondays, and the second group will attend the community sessions on Wednesdays.
5:23
Over a period of time, if the attendance in the light sessions in-person is lower,
5:33
then we can get rid of these rules and we can just allow anyone to join.
5:41
Join me in person for the rest who will be accessing the Q&A sessions remotely, we will do that on misdeeds.
5:49
The third part of the flip eating is the mini tutorial sessions and the coursework that goes along with it.
6:03
These sessions, these tutorials will take place in weeks three, five, seven and nine for one hour each.
6:13
You will have your same buteurs from the previous storm.
6:22
And they will be contacting you in week two to schedule the sessions in the following weeks.
6:28
The coursework deadlines will be a week after in weeks four, six, eight and 10, respectively for the four tutorials.
6:40
And you will be using Kate. I'm I'm asking you to publish to submit your work and to get feedback and see your marks.
6:52
The coursework account for only 15 percent of your total grades.
7:05
Finally, regarding office hours, so on Mondays and Wednesdays, on the same day when we have the lively live Q&A sessions.
7:12
I will be available between 10am and 4pm in my office, which is in Huxley three or six.
7:23
So if you have. Some questions or some doubts which have not been resolved while other mediums and you would like to meet me in person,
7:33
then you can do that in in this time slot.
7:46
There are some important links. One is aid.
7:52
We're a Q&A platform that I will be announcing, I'll be making announcements and answering your questions on it.
7:56
Number two is science, show it, I would be uploading all the resources, these are links to the videos and the textbook and slides, etc.
8:06
Panopto, this is where all the videos of both the pre-recorded videos and the like mini sessions,
8:20
which will also be recorded both will be published on Panopto.
8:27
And finally, Microsoft Teams, for those who will be accessing the live Q&A sessions remotely, they should do so on meetings.
8:34
Regarding doubts and questions, I strongly encourage you to use aid.
8:47
Not just to post questions, but also to answer doubts and questions raised by your friends in biofuels.
8:55
You can also ask your questions in the Q&A sessions. Obviously, it's just that I will be juggling between students.
9:05
Who are present in the lecture theatre in person and also students who are accessing remotely online.
9:16
So. It might be tricky, it might get a little messy, but I'll try my best to manage and the answer to questions coming from everywhere.
9:25
Then you also have the office hours, but. For office hours, I request you to come individually, audit at most in pairs due to COVID regulation,
9:40
and I think we are not allowed to gather in large numbers.
9:54
Just a small caveat regarding offices, I may have some urgent meetings which I cannot postpone or delay during those office hours.
10:02
So in in that case, I would request you to come a little later.
10:13
Or I'll request you to ask the same question on ED.
10:21
So, yeah, that's just a small caveat with officers.
10:29
Of course, you can also ask question to your buteurs.
10:33
But they may not know the answers to all questions in which case you will be again redirected to me.
10:37
Finally, you can also ask questions on. Microsoft Teams all are via email, but.
10:47
I would rather prefer if you. Post your questions on end or what in the Q&A sessions are in the office ups.
10:56
Next, I will be uploading videos in week two,
11:08
so I don't really expect you to have any questions in the live Q&A sessions in Week two because I have not yet uploaded any videos,
11:14
but I still encourage you to join me next week. Well, I will.
11:26
Present some motivating examples and get the discussion started.
11:35
So I'll see you in week two on Monday and Wednesday.
11:40
Bye bye.
