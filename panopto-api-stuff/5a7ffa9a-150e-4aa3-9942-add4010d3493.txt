Title: Netcraft ACI talk Oct 21
Category: Applications of Computing in Industry (ACI) Talks
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 02/11/2021
So welcome, everybody, to today's applications and competing in an industry seminar.
0:03
We're very pleased to have a very exciting company.
0:08
Alex from Net Krofft Nekrassov to arrange a very exciting computer security set of applications, which I'm sure we're going to learn more about.
0:13
And in particular, we're going to learn about how the coronavirus pandemic just was not only a biological pandemic,
0:25
it also launched a great wave of cybercrime.
0:33
So we'd love to learn more about that. Alex, please take it away.
0:39
Thanks very much. Well, thanks for having me. Everyone, thanks for coming.
0:44
My name's Alex. I've worked in that craft for about for about two months of time now since graduating from Imperial this year.
0:49
And I've also worked with the summer internship and my industrial placement in my third year during which I worked on rhinovirus, cybercrime.
0:58
And I've going to pursue a bit more about that today.
1:10
If you've got any questions during the talk, just feel free to say I don't know what the etiquette here.
1:12
The next interrupter to put up here to put up your hand, virtually anything worth.
1:17
I want it to be a bit more interactive. So let's get started.
1:25
I'm prepared to talk a little bit about who we are and what we do and then talk about.
1:30
Specifically, what we did was part of our cyber crime,
1:36
so we we deal with a lot of a lot of Internet crime and that a lot of our business protecting various types of rights,
1:38
apply for them to the crime and taking and taking countermeasures against them to try to get them off the Internet.
1:45
So that includes phishing malware, which purposes where a spy plane has been compromised system from the Prospero's,
1:50
which can mean, for example, that on some shopping sites that have been compromised if you type in your credit card.
2:04
And so not only does it go to the payment processor,
2:08
it also will go to the fraudster if they got a credit card scam on somebody so that people JavaScript and we be able to deal with bakeshop,
2:11
which I'm going to talk more about today. And can sites like server when an iPhone, by filling out the survey, that sort of thing.
2:18
And we'll have two other parts of the security testing as we do automated security scanning and also testing for some of our clients.
2:27
And we also do a lot of data mining on the Internet, including a Web server survey,
2:39
which I think is one of the oldest one there have there in the world the longest running.
2:45
And we count the number of computers that that our Internet facing, as well as the Internet, SSL and our company,
2:50
our clients are not mostly, but mainly in the U.K. And we also have client base in the US, Europe and elsewhere.
3:02
And so our customers, you can see on the right some probably some like that.
3:11
You recognise the largest company, the world's largest private sector,
3:17
largest tech companies and federal government, a country system, three trillion dollars in GDP.
3:21
We have offices in that. So there are our new offices in, of course.
3:29
But on the left, which we're expanding into the big office complex recently that we recently acquired.
3:34
And then and in London, we have in Victoria, just down the road.
3:42
That's where I am right now, just on the roof, Imperial, an office in Katherine place.
3:48
And so if you if you do a piece of work on a craft and you end up working with us,
3:55
you'll be working for probably one of these jobs if things are in person by the time, by the time your jump start.
4:00
So moving on to other crime, this is a classic success.
4:08
It doesn't require much imagination from the first year.
4:15
You can probably set one up if you know basic H.M.S. that maybe JavaScript, if you want it to be a bit more interactive.
4:18
And you can tell from that, look, there's the Phoenix House, they'll tell you it's not enough for the name.
4:25
And and let's say the real nice looking page change is maybe the fraudster will update it.
4:32
So that's kind of the extent of the input, like the the input, the closer the designs that they don't really do much of their own work.
4:39
But when Coronavirus came around,
4:47
we had to start dealing with fraudsters that the fraudsters that had a bit more of an imagination and started making up,
4:48
for example, a digital passport. And there's something called the digital passport in the UK anywhere,
4:54
I think in places in the UK where covid that can produce that not called a digital work, but the processor has made all of this up.
5:02
You can apply for a digital passport and they even have a few little touches that make it even more legitimate,
5:13
like how your data will be processed using the surface in the service and stuff like that.
5:19
So it looks it looks quite plausible, especially through kind of a less informed person,
5:25
because they've heard of some form of passport being issued and sort of QR codes.
5:30
So that's the sort of thing that we have, but not one of the ones they did before the government.
5:36
One of the things that were that we're trying to form countermeasures against to do with it.
5:42
But let's start off with the timeline, I think of that structure that took as things went on because the situation changed so often and so rapidly.
5:49
So in 2023, you should have a global health emergency.
5:59
But in the UK, I don't think many, very many people took much notice until March 20,
6:04
where eventually towards the end of the month, the UK was looked out to to prevent the spread of the virus.
6:10
And very suddenly, I think a lot of goods that were previously not as much the ban started being a lot of the.
6:17
So things like face masks and hand sanitiser and soap disinfectant, that sort of thing that people were trying to stay safe and probably were Anacapa.
6:23
Kind of because of the sudden. Of the sudden onset of the virus.
6:36
So a lot of fake shot came out like pops up, which had this sort of kind of very generic.
6:45
covid wording like, your safety is our top priority, and we know you you might be concerned about covid-19,
6:53
so shop on our site and get all the things you need. There are several of these sorts of sites.
7:01
This is a covid-19 that will try to sell and ninety five.
7:05
These are the sort of maps that government couldn't get a hold of because there weren't enough of them.
7:09
So it's very unlikely that around the Internet shop that has just been set up has
7:15
these maps and books and several governments were actually fooled by sites like this.
7:21
And some did end up having everybody in, some nearly handed over money to places that promised them a lot of maps that never turned up.
7:26
And you can see like hypnotic maps that they were selling, they were selling hand sanitiser promotor.
7:36
So this sort of thing and the software quite you can see right now are quite graphic design and very rapidly set up that
7:43
you can you can see how how quickly strength we have to take advantage of the panic that people had about covid-19.
7:52
The. The kind of there are also at the very start of March, I feel like right now, having you back, being around, that's normal.
8:02
But back in March, there was so we can talk about whether that would be possible.
8:11
And some some of these shots were already starting to sell vaccine to vaccine to keep you safe.
8:16
Again, covid. And you could buy a covid-19 vaccine for 50 euro or some current 275 euro.
8:23
And this sort of thing is pretty easy to tell, right. Whether or not it's fake because we know that the product doesn't exist.
8:32
So if if the source of this sort of thing is pretty easy to say, yeah, we should probably perform countermeasures against this sort of attack.
8:39
However, not all of the multiple shots from the Internet obviously are fake shot.
8:48
Right? There are there are small businesses. There are people who set up who who try to try to run a business on a or something or small businesses
8:53
that have been cleared by have been closed by the lockdown and started setting up shop online instead.
9:00
And so it to be tough to tell whether or not something and it's fake or not.
9:05
Does anyone want to get whether this particular screenshot from a shop is real or fake?
9:10
To me, it looks like a front end on top of Amazon or something, I'm not sure.
9:19
So this for this one, this particular one is real, and it was set up on a I don't think it's time that it was set up on.
9:27
I think it does, because he's a more generic template.
9:34
But we also have to use in our comfort to quickly set up Chuncho to buy things that we don't want to take.
9:37
We don't want to take down or perform countermeasures against shops that are that are
9:44
real because people might be wanting to buy from them that they say they consider.
9:50
So this kind of problem where. It's something there's extra stakes here, right?
9:56
You want to be really sure because I'm not sure often the people buying these sorts of things.
10:01
So we have a because of the volume of stuff that we were seeing,
10:08
we have to come up with a way of detecting whether or not these shots were fake without without having too many.
10:12
Is there any idea when. So we came up with a list of kind of criteria that maybe not individually on their own, but in combination,
10:22
if several of the criteria applied, then we would say that on the balance of probabilities, it was a big shock.
10:32
So the first the first criterion is that everything is OK, because right now or I don't know the U.K.,
10:38
but generally right now it's pretty normal for things to be a stock even based.
10:46
But back in March 2020, there weren't enough to go around.
10:52
So if everything's on the books, then different types of hand sanitiser promoters, that sort of thing.
10:57
If everything seems a bit suspicious already, especially if the cards are in place of.
11:05
So another red flag of lack of contact details.
11:12
So this is kind of saying. It's very unlikely that a legitimate.
11:16
covid-19 wholesale supplier is going to be offering more than Gmail address or will only have a contact
11:22
form and no details about where in the world they're located to go to most legitimate businesses.
11:29
They have like on the Internet, they have their. Physical attraction,
11:35
presence on the on the on the on the site and of like there's often very little
11:41
contact details on bakeshop because obviously they want to put their real stuff,
11:48
the real details there in case they were found by the authority.
11:52
And also they often have an explanation of why they suddenly have the best security for the nation.
11:56
We were a textile company and we used to make clothes, but now we started making Spacelab drink over method.
12:02
Right. You can tell where they got the materials, that sort of thing from the expertise, and they can take that.
12:08
But if it's just a shot that set up with just a Gmail address, just the contact form, then that's a little bit of a red flag, obviously, on its own.
12:14
It's not it's not a factor. But when combined with others, it makes the software more suspicious.
12:21
A lot of shops will have dinner on the page, but the big shop, so they'll describe whatever it is and they'll be simple precautions.
12:29
You can take that they say Panopto that while on the phone, that might sound a bit annoying.
12:36
The reason the fake shops do this is because they want to get higher and better track.
12:42
If somebody Googled how to protect yourself against covid-19,
12:46
they want to be one of the one of the revolt and the way that they become one of the results by personal attacks on their page.
12:51
And the way that you can tell that a lot of the attacks is kind of boilerplate stuff is because often have been copied, pasted from somewhere,
12:57
probably another shop and probably another fake shop with the same owner,
13:05
use the same plates and their uses because they want to set up multiple shops in case some are taken down.
13:08
So that's kind of generic text is, again, a suspicious sign,
13:14
but also if it's duplicated across several different shops, that it's probably a red flag.
13:21
And the final two factors are that are based in a domain of newly registered.
13:28
If a business has been operating for a while, their demand might be well be new.
13:33
But if some folks are just set up a domain and then hopefully on a platform like Shopify but not exclusively Shopify,
13:37
where you can set up a shop that very quickly, you can get generic templates and get up and running really fast then.
13:46
It's likely that it was that it was set up by a fire by foot.
13:56
And so none of these factors individually, but in combination, a lot of factors will tell us the company of the picture.
14:01
And there are a few more factors that I'm not going to go into right now for the campaign.
14:08
But things like Facebook, applications for for all the things that people can for like some shop,
14:13
upload a fake regulatory certificate for working correctly.
14:18
You could tell if they were fake. So that was another matter.
14:24
For example, there were several. So this was mostly around.
14:29
This was happening mostly around March, April, May 20.
14:35
But then the numbers started getting probably because these things started becoming more generally available again.
14:39
And people weren't panicking as much. When people are panicking and tend not to look out for signs of something is fake and.
14:46
There were also other scams that they set up around May, June, July,
14:54
time to do with tax refunds and business support, stuff like that that will get onto later at the book.
14:59
So another thing that they started doing here at the same time in March is take advantage of the schemes designed for people affected by the lockdown.
15:07
So people who are self-employed or people who were who were told to stay at home from their jobs and put on Furley.
15:16
So here's an example, email that was sent by someone who says there is an American custom there from the email,
15:25
I can tell it they're not on the oh, you have a tax refund for your business because you were locked down so it could get started.
15:32
And we'll give you some money on.
15:40
And when you add this is another page, is the Self Employment Income Support Scheme, which is a real thing, they started asking for personal details.
15:43
Another is going to continue. You're going to be asked for even more personal details and then those details can be sold online.
15:52
So people might want to try and might want a national insurance number of the self-employed person or something like that.
15:59
And here's another example of an email on the left start to claim the right to covid-19 percent,
16:08
which is something that doesn't exist, and it was made up by the fraudster and the kind of.
16:16
Most interesting part of this particular scam is that you should wait because you should wait for weeks after making an online claim to say basically,
16:23
if you don't have the money, wait until it's four weeks after and then contact HMRC.
16:34
And that means that the protesters have four weeks to play with somebody before they might get rumbled.
16:39
And because and this sort of tax is usually quite normal for I don't know if anyone's ever dealt with HMRC, but it's quite normal for HMRC.
16:45
It'll take this long for the purpose of the application it took until until this many weeks after.
16:53
So this sort of stuff is a bit nefarious and tried to give a bit more time to say that these.
17:00
For Flight 447 details. So emails are the only factor for delivering the sorts of scam,
17:08
some tests are sent out to try to grab the 1000 pounds of company by Texcoco stock crisis,
17:19
which sounds very legitimate, and they ask for something national insurance number for a private account.
17:27
They may not. And there were so many different schemes being floated by the government and not just in the UK,
17:34
but around the world, that somebody might plausibly think the crisis created something real.
17:41
And they even have more protests in got the UK here like the new feed that will help us improve it to try to get people to attract a bit more.
17:47
And obviously, if somebody's panicking or if somebody is strapped,
17:59
then they might not notice that this looks that this doesn't look particularly real, especially at the bottom of the page here.
18:02
Yeah, so we saw a lot of these come and we also see a lot of fights that might look like some might not be in a lot of kind of full report.
18:12
But we need to make sure that we that we because we receive a lot of them, it's impossible to quantify all of them manually.
18:21
And so we would want to do it automatically as some kind of focus right now,
18:28
how we automatically go through and quantify and then disrupt the sort of count, but also the pet shop.
18:32
So the first step is to find sites that are kind of candidate to be three blocks from our various inputs.
18:40
So the first email we ascribe to quite a few feet of spam email, we ingest millions and millions and millions of them.
18:48
And we can tell that email is a scam.
18:58
If it's. For example, the Senate confirmation of revenue, but the emails are not Asian revenue and customs,
19:06
and they find that they can, then it's probably not Asian revenue.
19:13
And so we can say that the link into the email system,
19:18
we should have a question and we could do that for a lot of for a lot of that in the public or to send them their own report.
19:21
So if you see something, you can email it to commit macropod Commonwealth automatically.
19:28
Have a look at the. So then another one, the maths, like I showed you earlier, people can report their recommended to us,
19:33
you can send a screenshot even and we'll we'll parse out the ARE and the final kind of main input more into the final main one is then file.
19:40
So those files are what, DNS provider. So what registrars use to kind of say which domain belongs to who and a lot of you,
19:52
a lot of you were top-level domains like not directed at the council will give up,
20:06
but will publish its own files with newly registered El-Katatney,
20:11
which means we can we can monitor the newly registered domain and see if something looks at estimators up on them.
20:16
And a lot of providers have been published and publicly will give up their own files for us to read anyway because of it.
20:26
So, yeah, they recommend filing.
20:36
You can see inside it probably doesn't fit in here,
20:40
but the director would have been prepared earlier and we would have been able
20:43
to we would have we would have been able to monitor compliance with this.
20:46
And so that's the kind of first that's fine. So the second one is actually determining whether or not they're.
20:52
And so we have a very complex system for this that has a lot of moving parts.
20:58
But I'm going to I'm going to briefly talk about one main aspect of it, which is patronisation.
21:02
So we can for example, we know that the UK.
21:10
The UK is the only domain where the UK logo and all content is available on the open government licence,
21:17
like the flare up here and the Crown copyright notice. What have I done?
21:24
That area where all of that stuff will only be for will only be uncovered.
21:29
OK, so if that isn't covered you of the text, it's like it could be a scam.
21:35
So we can block it out of town. And you can see the British target, the south.
21:41
And I think it's a little earlier. And then we are using human intervention, we build up a lot of pattern for for classifying this sort of site,
21:46
but we have to look for different types of scams,
22:00
different that the got stuck and we built up when when when we when we see from our monitoring a lot of new attacks targeting.
22:03
And then when we notice that we can automatically block progress to the next step, which is getting it taken down from the Internet.
22:13
And so we open up automated emails to a lot of people who are involved in the infrastructure for hosting a scam like this.
22:22
So this is an email that we would send to I think it's the hoster that we sent this email to for the directive that this is something fraudulent.
22:31
We think about on the surface, it might not be effective, but it's really effective,
22:41
especially because a lot of folks trust us to report them and they will then take them down.
22:46
So this is the this is that is an example of know, we don't only contact the host,
22:54
we contact the friends party because sometimes people don't cooperate with taking things down.
22:58
But then eventually you can get that majority of of these attacks taken down relatively quickly,
23:03
usually within a few days, I think, for the start of the attack.
23:11
And yeah, then but then we don't know whether it's actually been taken down.
23:15
So we we monitor it continuously. We like from the point that we determine that it's that it's malicious to see whether
23:21
or not it has been taken down by the by the various organisations you contact.
23:29
So here you have the impact that the page matches the hash of the page that we know is malicious and you have a two hundred response code.
23:35
And then eventually after a while it had a four four response code and a different hash and also redirected to a different website,
23:46
which means that it probably is that it probably is down now to be monitoring it.
23:55
The reason why this is important is that we can see whether there are any providers that are bad things that we can work on,
24:01
new ways of getting things done and also on the region so we can unblock it from somebody.
24:08
Yeah, because there's no point blocking it. The they can dump. And then at the end, she's got the.
24:18
And there was a human intervention required sometimes,
24:27
obviously there is human intervention required on a small minority of attacks that are either borderline or quite difficult to take down.
24:30
But the vast majority are just taking down the disease and it's quite effective.
24:38
So moving on back in time, line of 10 in May 2020,
24:45
the UK announced a test and trace of them to test people who might have covered and to contact people who were close contacts of
24:52
those who might have had to have it so that you could predict the spread of the virus and to help the open up Twitter again.
25:03
And so, as you might imagine, protesters very quickly started the trip and instead of up, start setting up Gary,
25:14
pay just like this and telling the people saying you've been in contact with someone who has tested positive,
25:21
you must follow the other procedures or you will face a fine of prosecution even if you've been vaccinated.
25:26
Bear in mind that this is a before the vaccine and.
25:33
Then they said, oh, you must order a pizza to continue,
25:37
you press continue and you get to please enter your payment details to pay for the Republican attack.
25:41
And obviously, there's no tax going to come to them and it's not going to be super mentalistic off the card,
25:46
probably going to sell the credit card number to somebody else.
25:51
But the but the this sort of thing, if if somebody is afraid of private, which most people were.
25:53
And you're also afraid of being prosecuted and you have all that very legally, he will be prosecuted in fines and you must do that,
26:03
then people might not think too much about where they got the link from or how
26:11
they got to the site and they'll just have to until their credit card details.
26:15
And so obviously, we've described the other scandals before, we have automated detection and countermeasures to get this far,
26:20
simpler to detect because you can look for the traits in a page and the logo and stuff like that and for other purposes.
26:29
The Majestic.
26:38
So then in June, I say that you could start to look down and and sever ties when you have proved to Pfizer and if you take a vaccine and again,
26:42
as before, schemata responded by setting up pages where you buy the AstraZeneca sorry,
26:56
the type of vaccine, it's very unlikely that they actually have any side effects because you might have 40 to them,
27:02
but 23 degrees Celsius or something like that. So for they'll be useful.
27:09
It's very unlikely that they have it, but because it requires specialised equipment and stuff like that to are the telegram channels
27:14
that we're trying to sell vaccine card into the vaccine court isn't a proof of that connexion.
27:23
It's just a medical record for you to keep the covid.
27:29
There were a lot of speculation about requiring governments that have to pay the Piper team later on,
27:34
which means that some people who didn't want to be vaccinated wants to a philosophical hand.
27:41
So people started telling people to discard things like telegram.
27:46
You can do countermeasures against this sort of thing, too, because it's because the critics are going to get it taken down.
27:50
And we have systems that automatically monitor ground groups like the.
27:55
And we even found it hard to fail by a seller on Amazon,
28:01
where they even were generous enough to bundle in a second boxing card so you can give on to a friend and the.
28:07
Yeah, this sort of this sort of say is anything different than what we told him about by third party seller,
28:17
but there was a lot of demand for that sort of thing and maybe they even with to cart.
28:24
But it's still something that.
28:28
One would want to sit down because people because, for example, some countries were using, even though it wasn't meant to be a vaccination.
28:33
Some countries were using different vaccination for entry.
28:40
Like I remember, I think it was Greece that started using in part, a vaccination before the NHL made to our kids in or out.
28:43
And this is an example of a dark market that's behind the on the dark Web site behind
28:58
talk so you can't find where it's being hosted or who's taking it particularly easily.
29:04
So you can't we can't perform countermeasures against something like this to sell it for information to have.
29:10
For example, AstraZeneca has been sold on the table for eight hundred ninety four dollars generic Corona vaccine for five hundred million,
29:17
but they're in for forty four thousand five hundred. And.
29:26
Probably wouldn't have received anything if he did receive something,
29:31
it probably would be fakes if he bought it from here, but it's still to see how quickly this sort of thing pops up.
29:34
And they replace any one, the government confirms that there would be private passports and they would be enforced.
29:42
Since then, the government has turned.
29:49
But at the moment, at that moment in April 2001, it was announced that there was confirmation that it would be you.
29:50
So there's a bit of to be sending out a digital passport.
30:01
Registration form to get people that it have no national insurance number and if you're
30:08
excited about being able to so so go to places that you're about to entitle you to go to,
30:13
then you might quickly think it's a good beginning.
30:20
And what they you out the form, you've got a QR code, and I don't know if anyone can the QR code yet,
30:26
but but I'm sure I could eventually lead to QR code monkey.
30:31
They didn't even bother to change the default, Yooralla said much the same bit of the same code.
30:37
And you will if they were banking on their standard.
30:42
There were also Instagram profiles set up to sell these sort of like the NHS,
30:49
but they seem they they were going to sell you a a some sort of website or something like that.
30:54
And there are people here and 50 people claim to get it to be shown on government systems, which seem quite dubious.
31:03
But it's. So we reported the cost and taken down.
31:10
We have software sites like Instagram, and this is another one of those which also claims to put it into the NHS database.
31:16
So you've been vaccinated and you would pay for hundred pounds for that.
31:28
And even if you knew a topic, we have live reports that if it was from because you're paying for something that's not that's not that's not legal.
31:31
So you wouldn't be able to go to the police afterwards and say, somebody stole my three hundred pound.
31:43
That kind of a perfect. But some of the programme group and there was also something called hack and trade,
31:49
which are set up for people who didn't want to be vaccinated but still wanted a vaccine, what it what it claims to be vaccinated.
31:57
And they set up a site that would that would generate a fake version of the apps in the browser with a QR code to say that you've been vaccinated.
32:08
And we take this site down because they infringe on the actual trademark and the.
32:20
The these sites are they keep popping up every so often and we keep finding them, taking them down.
32:28
But yeah, that's kind of messed up to say if anyone's got any question, that is a great time.
32:37
If you're interested in applying to work in that company, things like that, American cyber crime, email your CV to see the other comments.
32:45
If if you if you want more information or visit the of job.
32:54
William, thanks. That was absolutely fascinating. I mean, I'd be interested in these sites, you know, they get taken down.
33:02
Does anything ever happen to the people that are running them?
33:09
And do you get the impression that there was a small group of people running a lot of the
33:13
a lot of the sites or the or is the ownership of the of the scam is much more widespread?
33:19
And it's difficult to say,
33:28
but there are a lot of kind of kids that are sold by cameras not set up to buy and sell it to people to host on their own, on their own platform.
33:30
So it could be that it's very few people that it could also be that there's a lot, but a lot.
33:40
We see a lot of kind of closing of the site.
33:44
But clearly, there are kids being sold to set up your own and they have done that sort of thing in terms of anything happening to them after.
33:47
We have no idea really most of these artists in the U.K.,
33:58
they're hosted in countries where they don't really care whether they whether they're whether
34:03
the country or parties there don't care whether there are forces or in their country.
34:09
They're not part of they're not targeting. So it's not a kind of very rarely you get these people, unfortunately.
34:13
Yeah, that's interesting, right? Does anybody have any questions? Please post them in the chat room.
34:22
Raise your hand or just just ask. Maybe what people think about, I can ask another one,
34:28
so I saw in one of your slides there that you had the bit of Bitcoin and Ethereum involved in the in the scam there.
34:38
You know,
34:47
that's another sign of a scam when people ask you to pay in a in an irreversible kind of a transaction on some other non-traditional payment network.
34:47
Right. How often do you see cryptocurrency related scams?
34:59
So we actually have an entire kind of attack that we go after called cryptocurrency investment scam,
35:07
which are I don't know if you've ever seen the fake news article of Richard Branson has,
35:14
it's one way of making ten thousand dollars a day,
35:22
and it's often involves signing up with some dodgy platform that claims to be selling you cryptocurrency investments.
35:26
But that that that sort of thing, we see a lot of and it's very widespread.
35:34
And we've actually tracked down roughly where these people are operating from, mainly one group.
35:38
But in terms of the two we've covered, there's very I think we see very much of it because usually people are just after credit card numbers.
35:46
But for example, take pharmacy to places itself. Take the cell, take drugs are unlike pharmacies online.
35:56
A lot of them accept payments in the currency because they can't they can't take payments
36:05
and using credit cards because Visa or MasterCard or their payment processor can block.
36:10
And so, I mean, what happens to people's details after they've after they've been taken by these scams?
36:18
Do do do they do they find their credit cards and stuff being used for other purchases and stuff for.
36:27
Yes, so generally the scammers themselves, they don't tend to use the credit cards themselves of that double the number of the people involved.
36:33
I don't know what the going rate for credit card number is at the moment,
36:42
but I think I was once scammed on a traditional ATM skimmer like it was an in-person one that read my credit card details and it ended up being there,
36:45
ended up being withdrawals and rupee's I think about two or three months later.
37:00
Have halfway around the world, so I assume that's what happened, your car gets get home and people who make stability, withdrawal.
37:08
Great, right? Anybody else have a question?
37:18
This is a great opportunity, I might tell you,
37:23
NECROTISING are doing some of the most interesting and amazing work out there right now with regards to network security.
37:27
So anything you're curious about, please do ask. Anything, generally, A doesn't have to be covered, related, I'm happy to answer questions.
37:35
I mean, in terms of opportunities that there are for the students, are you still doing presumably industrial placements and so on,
37:51
and you're interested in any any graduates with with network security skills?
38:00
Definitely we do internships that can be a compulsive placement for people doing the image there.
38:07
Everyone is welcome to apply. We also are happy to work on I don't I don't know what it's like to get that final year project probably had the bumper,
38:15
but for final year project, we are also happy to collaborate with people.
38:25
We've got a lot of data, which means that you can build very interesting things with it.
38:30
So if people are interested in collaborating on a five year project, you get in touch as well.
38:36
The same email address would work for about CVN across dot com.
38:41
We certainly had a number of very exciting undergraduate projects and the students have then gone on to work for phone that cross, that's for sure.
38:47
Right. Alexa says, Do you find it common for scammers to use personalised links to circumvent your scanning?
38:58
That's an interesting question. What do you mean by personal, I think.
39:04
Do you mean if you mean like with a separate link per scan, like for each type of email,
39:10
you send a separate link for each person that might have a different query parameter or something like that.
39:16
Exactly. I think I've figured out it's relatively common because not just because they want to circumvent that common down,
39:21
but they just want to see which email addresses people click on from because the details are far more valuable to somebody who can be fooled.
39:33
The generally, it isn't very effective against our government because we will just because we get a lot of spam emails.
39:42
So we will just end up visiting one of these one of these sites anyway.
39:51
If they've got if they've got logic, I don't know, limit it to a certain number of visitors.
39:56
Some common fishcake might have that logic. If they do, then I think we have to have some logic to reverse directories then.
40:02
And the you are out to try to get to somewhere where we can see the future.
40:09
I mean, that's usually the personalisation is just an email and the query parameter.
40:17
So any any email in there will be and we will we will obviously strip that before reporting it or strip them for blocking it, but for everyone.
40:24
OK, Charles, how do you balance your detection criteria to avoid false alarms and legitimate uses?
40:39
I was going to ask if there were problem with false positives every now and then.
40:45
Do you simply tweak the criteria to be more stringent until you get more complaints?
40:49
And so with generally when not to have covered?
40:55
Yeah, if we see that some part of our detection policies will work on reducing that.
41:01
And we also have as part of our pipeline, the negative classifier,
41:07
the classifier that will say that's not a fish rather than that is a fish that we can try to remove common false positive,
41:10
like obviously we will never avoid if we're doing any kind of automation.
41:25
We will never avoid having we'll never get direct to do with the KOVA stuff because the stakes are a bit higher because we would probably
41:29
be disrupting a legitimate business if we if we started taking down if we if we were starting to take down things which are freer.
41:38
I think what we were doing it for a while when we were when we were creating more broadly find a
41:47
new type of gun will we will have to work for a while without any countermeasures against that,
41:53
against the like, get the shot to the head so that we can check that it isn't too noisy and that it isn't triggering too many for.
41:59
That's mainly what we do to avoid those, and obviously we have different.
42:15
Kind of pattern of sight that generally are known to be legitimate sites that are popular in the
42:25
country that we want to have a second look at by a human to check that they're actually done.
42:30
But those are some of the ways we avoid we avoid this.
42:38
Yeah, I mean, you do you do have quite a nice kind of like reporting front, and it's really easy for people to report suspicious sites.
42:43
Right. Which you can then investigate. Yeah, that's reports that an aircraft you can report there if you find enough scans.
42:52
Well, I think they're appropriate for people who who who give us enough Canizaro.
43:03
But if even if you're not interested in it, we can get something blocked in major browsers quite quickly if you report something to us.
43:10
Yeah, it's quite nice because you get those status updates and stuff about it as well, isn't it?
43:19
Well, sometimes it takes a while. It can take a while sometimes when there's a backlog, but generally it's relatively flat.
43:24
Yeah, know very, very useful, very good combination, I think, of like human input and automation and and so on.
43:33
Great. Okay, anybody got a final question? All very shy today, is the coursework starting to bite, right?
43:42
Yeah, a lot of stuff, too, from what I gather.
44:06
Yeah, I think it's getting to that time of year.
44:10
But listen, thank you, Alex. That was absolutely fascinating.
44:14
I really appreciate you taking time to come and tell us about these very interesting aspects of network security.
44:19
That's right. Thanks very much for having me. Great.
44:28
And I hope you get some good feedback from the students and lots of applications for internships, placements, graduate positions and so on.
44:31
Thanks a lot. Hope. Thanks. Thanks very much. Have a great day.
