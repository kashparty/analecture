Let's recall the travelling salesman problem. GSP for short,
0:01
given a complete weighted Grauwe GW find a tour of the graph of minimum weight which visits each node exactly wants and returns to the start note.
0:07
We'd like to show that this problem is ENPI complete and deduce from that that it is intractable.
0:18
But if you think about it, this is not a decision problem. This is an optimisation problem.
0:26
It says find a tour, which is the best. And we're trying to find something which is the best.
0:31
Whereas, ah, complexity classes aren't just defined for decision problems, which are ones which have answers which are.
0:37
Yes, no. But fortunately, there is a standard way to convert an optimisation problem like T.
0:44
S P in to a decision problem. So let's define the decision version of GSP TSB Brackett's D for decision giving away to Grauwe,
0:51
GW and A bound B, which you can think of as a sort of budget that the travelling salesman has.
1:02
Is there a tour of G with total weight less than or equal to be so.
1:08
Okay. So it says in this version of the problem, we don't want to find the best tour.
1:13
It will be nice, but we don't need to do that. We just know we've got a certain budget or time or petrol or whatever, and we just want to know,
1:20
can we get around the cities and get back to at the start without exceeding our budget?
1:28
So this now is a decision problem. It's obviously got an extra parameter in the input the B.
1:34
And what we're going to do is to show that the decision version of GSP is ENPI complete using our method.
1:42
So those two ingredients, first, we have to show that it's in ENPI using our gas in cheque technique.
1:49
So what is the thing that we should guess here for the travelling salesman?
1:59
Well, pretty obviously it is the tour, the path pie. So we just guess that path and then we can cheque in polynomial time.
2:03
But it is a Hamiltonian circuit. If the original graph in other words,
2:12
it visits each node exactly once and gets back to the start and that the weight of
2:16
the path just adding up the weights of the arcs in the path is within the budget.
2:20
And it's also the case, pretty obviously, that the length of the path is going to be bounded in the length of the graph.
2:27
So that gives us the polynomial bounded path. We want to be a bit more formal about this.
2:37
We can actually define the verification problem associated with T SPDR.
2:43
So we're call Verify T SPDM takes four inputs.
2:48
In fact, the graph, the weighting, the budget, B and the path, and it is holes if and only if PI is a Hamiltonian circuit of the graph.
2:53
And the weight of Pi is Lessner equal to be.
3:06
And that then can be is polynomial.
3:12
It's undecidable predicate. We have the property, we want that to SPDM of the graph.
3:16
And B holds if and only if there exists a PI such that the right hand side here.
3:23
And the size of the path is bounded by the size of the graph, as we already said.
3:30
So that is the polynomial bounded part here.
3:35
So I'm just restating slightly more formally what we stated informally in this line at the top here.
3:39
Well, so that was the easy part. That should always be easy to show that a problem is in ENPI using the gas and cheque method.
3:48
More interesting is to show that some known ENPI complete problem d prime reduces to T SPDM.
3:57
Well, we haven't got too many and b complete problems so far. I mean, in real life we weren't.
4:05
We would have thousands to choose from. But we've only got sat and Hamiltonian path.
4:09
Well, Sacha's a logic problem. TSB is a graft problem.
4:15
So Hamiltonian path being a graft problem looks like the better choice.
4:19
And indeed, you can see that the travelling salesman tour is very closely related to Hamiltonian paths.
4:24
So what we're obviously going to want to show is that Hamiltonian path reduces
4:30
to T SPDM and that will then show that that T SPDM is indeed ENPI complete.
4:35
OK, well, so now the interesting part. How can we do that reduction?
4:46
We have got to transform a graph G for Hamiltonian path problem into a weighted graph together with the bound.
4:51
So we want to convert dree into G prime. Add in some weights and decide what the B is.
5:03
So notice we've got to construct G, prime W and B here.
5:10
And we want this property to hold Hamiltonian part G if and only if G, Prime W and B is A Yes.
5:16
Instance of the travelling salesman problem. OK, so what is our idea here.
5:23
Well perhaps if we just go to the next slide to give the idea here.
5:31
So here is the graph on the left. In the green. And does this have a Hamiltonian path?
5:37
Well, no, because you can go A.B.C., but then you're stuck. You have to repeat B.
5:42
So this is a no instance here. But we'd like to convert that into a travelling salesman problem.
5:47
Similarly, this one here is a yes instance. We can obviously go ABC Deam.
5:55
We have a Hamiltonian path. So how can we get a travelling salesman problem?
5:59
Well, first thing is we have to get a complete graph. So we add in all the arcs that are we're not there in the original.
6:05
But if we want to say that having a Hamiltonian path implies a low value travelling salesman tour.
6:13
So our our idea is to let's say that the the end the arcs that really exist in the original graph.
6:23
Let's give them a low weighting. Let's say one. And the arcs that we've added in the dotted lines in the red.
6:30
Here. Let's give them a high rating because we shouldn't be allowed to use them.
6:37
If we gave them a low rating, then we could obviously get a low value travelling salesman tour.
6:43
So because so if we want to do a travelling salesman tour and get the weighting as low as possible,
6:49
we try to use the green ox as much as possible so we can go ABC.
6:56
But then we're stuck. We can't use anymore of the green. So we have to go to D.
7:02
Which costs us a lot too. And then from D back to A.
7:07
So we have to use two arcs that didn't exist in the original and costing us money.
7:12
So that means we're getting six overall is the best that we can do.
7:17
If you if you analyse it for doing the travelling salesman tour here, what about this one where we know there is a yes.
7:23
So we can do better here because we can use green, green, green.
7:31
Oh yes. But there isn't a Hamiltonians circuit, so not in this example anyway.
7:35
So we have to use a red one, which is costing us to get back to the start.
7:40
But that still gives us one, two, three, four, five.
7:45
So we can do this one in five. If a travelling salesman, Turbit, this one, we can only do in six.
7:50
And notice, the five is one more than the number of nodes here.
7:57
So we can do basically we've got the Hamilton in in general.
8:03
You can see that. If there is a Hamiltonian path, then that has N minus one ARC's in it.
8:09
And then we have to possibly complete with a new fictitious arc.
8:15
One of the red dotted ones. So that will give us the total weight of N minus one for the Hamiltonian path,
8:19
plus the possible two to get us back to the start, which gives us the weight of N plus one overall.
8:25
Anyway, I'm actually give the construction on this previous slide here.
8:31
So what we're going to have the same nodes in G Prime is in Jane.
8:37
And if you go any two distinct nodes X and Y, and if there is an arc in G, then we leave it in.
8:43
And we give a low weighting of one. If if X Y is not an arc, then we put it in.
8:52
To complete the graph. But we give it a high weighting of two.
8:57
So the missing arts are added in. But with the higher weight to discourage us from using them in the travelling salesman to add the budget,
9:02
as we've seen from our analysis on those two examples,
9:09
should be N plus one, because that's enough to allow us to use a Hamiltonian path plus one extra arc to get us back to the start.
9:12
So that's. And then. We've said the reduction function F of G produces what we've just described up here,
9:21
and it's pretty easy to see that this is a polynomial time operation because perhaps the
9:29
easiest way to see that is to just think about the adjacency matrix representation.
9:35
We've got ones and zeros in the original one for G. We're simply replacing the zeros by twos to put them in.
9:40
We're giving them away. Shift to. So that's our construction.
9:48
So that's polynomial time. What we then and here are the examples we've already discussed.
9:52
What we need to cheque now is that the reduction property actually holds.
10:00
G has a Hamiltonian path. If and only if our new construction has a travelling salesman to within the budget.
10:06
B which is the end plus one. So let me need to prove this.
10:15
And we have to prove in both directions, because it's an if and only if for this reduction property.
10:20
So let's suppose that G has got a Hamiltonian path and maybe it has X and points X and Y, and let's have a diagram for that.
10:25
Here is Jeanne, I'll just draw like that in case that's gee, we've got a Hamiltonian path within it,
10:37
which is just goes through all the nodes so destroyed like that with these wavy line X and Y like that.
10:46
So and then finally, we've got Ann.
10:56
Okay. So this path in G prime. This will have wait N minus one because as N minus one asks in this path here, because it's a Hamiltonian path.
11:02
And then we need to add in the last one here, which will have a weight of two,
11:14
because that was a fictitious arc that we added in to the weighted graph.
11:21
Okay. And so that gives us the travelling salesman tour.
11:27
And that two has weight less than or equal to and plus.
11:32
Well, I should say sorry that I said this is a fictitious one and it is possible that this arc already existed in G,
11:35
but it's in the worst case it didn't.
11:45
And so so we all we can say is that this has weight, either one or two.
11:49
But in the worst case, it could be, too. So this is actually G prime. We've converted it into the weighted graph here.
11:53
So. OK. That's one way round.
12:00
Conversely, let's suppose that G Prime has got a tour.
12:04
So let's perhaps have a double diagram. So here is G prime.
12:09
And it's gotten to. There is a tour and it's got weight less than or equal to.
12:14
And plus one. Well, but if you think about it, this has got to have an ARC's in it because there are end nodes in G prime.
12:22
So if the wait is less than or equal to one plus one, then at least N minus one of the arcs must have one.
12:33
So there can be only one. OK, that's got wait too.
12:40
So perhaps it's this one here has got to and that's between let's say X and Y but then all the other way it's a one all around here.
12:44
So then the rest of the, just the, the part of this, the two from X to Y gives us a weight,
12:55
gives us a Hamiltonian path in the original graph because all of these have got weight one and therefore existed in G already.
13:03
So omitting the arc x y gives us a Hamiltonian path in energy.
13:12
And we conclude that T. SPDR is enpi compete using our method because we've finished verifying that F is indeed a valid reduction.
13:17
Okay, well earned just to polish off.
13:28
We can now finally show that travelling salesman is intractable, which is what we wanted to prove all along.
13:33
Let's assume the P is not equal to ENPI. And let's suppose for a contradiction that travelling salesman can be solved by a polynomial time algorithm.
13:40
Well, then we can use that algorithm and we can compute the optimal to the optimal value.
13:50
In polynomial time, but then we can immediately solve the decision version in polynomial time because we just compute.
13:57
Oh. And then we just cheque whether O is less than equal to our budget.
14:04
B, if it's. Yes. Then we.
14:09
Well, if it's we can, we can.
14:14
Obviously, if I was less Meikle to be, then we have a yes. But but this is impossible.
14:18
Why is that? Because TSB, D and P complete. We've just shown that and we assume that P is not equal to ENPI and any problem,
14:25
therefore that is enpi complete cannot be is not tractable, is not polynomial time.
14:33
But we've just shown that two days. And so we have the contradiction and therefore travelling salesman.
14:39
The true problem here, the optimisation problem, not the decision version, is intractable.
14:46
