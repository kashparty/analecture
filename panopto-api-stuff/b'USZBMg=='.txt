Title: Q&A2
Category: COMP40017 - Linear Algebra (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
Who? Perfect.
0:05
All right. So there's. Yeah.
0:09
All right, so today's Q&A second session will be about solving some system of linear equations.
0:18
So even before we go on to learn about vectors and make those cases and Mukasey's the more fundamental problem that we are solving the most,
0:30
the basic problem on which the entire linear algebra based upon is solving a system of linear equations.
0:39
This is something most of you have already studied in your high school,
0:48
but I I believe we still need to start from here because everything builds up from this basic problem.
0:53
So, yeah, so we are going to solve a system of linear equations.
1:01
So solving. System.
1:10
Of linear equations. And this this session would be interactive.
1:20
Basically, I'll ask you this and tell me the answers.
1:29
Again, the problems would be pretty straightforward and easy.
1:32
So what are Lehnert equations first, so linear equations are defined as anything which looks like this.
1:37
Anyone? X1 Plus two, X2 Plus.
1:50
Dot, dot, dot. And Exxon equals.
2:00
B, is this a linear does it? This is what this is a general definition of a linear equation when all the air is.
2:06
Our guys co-efficient, thanks. And all the excise are called variables are unknown.
2:20
So I call them variables.
2:37
There are also four unknowns. And B is just a constant.
2:45
These are also some banks called free co-efficient because you can think of B as being.
2:52
It's not being multiplied by any variable. So in this case, there are any variables and one equation.
3:01
So let's look at a few examples. First, let's say any quotes.
3:12
One. Basically, just one variable. Something like, let me say an equal one and an example could be three x equals six.
3:19
Easy to solve. What is the solution to this easy, simple solution, one unique solution, which is X, equals two now and equals two.
3:36
And let us have an equation with two variables to announce, and I use an example X plus two y equals three.
3:55
What is a solution to this equation?
4:15
Can anyone? Yeah, yeah.
4:19
The gender solution, but let's start.
4:24
Maybe I should have defined what you mean by a solution any.
4:29
Any values of these are known variables which satisfy the equation is a solution, correct?
4:35
So more formally. I'll define what the solution is more formally for this equation the gender, the gender, the form of a linear equation.
4:41
So. All right.
4:56
Any. Collection of lamb No.1 lamb to write, these are all values, they're all really value members scales.
5:04
Lambda and. Belonging to.
5:18
And with. Satisfies.
5:26
This equation, so basically summation of a I no, I I from one to N equals B if this is true.
5:34
Then we say that this collection of lambda eyes is a solution to that equation, to that linear equation.
5:47
So one solution could be we could have.
5:57
X as one and Y as one.
6:03
So one solution could be X equals one.
6:07
And Y equals one. Right.
6:13
This is one solution for the sake of all solutions, which is what you pointed out would be something like y equals.
6:18
Minus X by two plus a three, by two.
6:31
Is that correct? This is what your gender solution was. I said I I'm sorry, I gave specific speech.
6:37
Oh, you want to be specific? So I thought you gave the genders of my back.
6:47
All right. So this is the gender solution in the gender solution. Please note that we are seeing why some function of X.
6:54
In other words, we are letting in this particular form, we are letting X to be free.
7:06
It can it can fluctuate, it's a free variable, and it has a special name, which is free variable.
7:15
And why is it dependent media wise, dependent on what I could have rewritten the same equation in another form,
7:26
something like let me be in some space.
7:35
Something like the same equation, in fact, rewritten in a different way.
7:47
X is equal to three minus two right now in this representation in this form.
7:57
Why is the free variable and X is dependent on that for you?
8:06
We are allowing Y to me and X would depend on this free variable.
8:11
Both represent the same thing geometrically. You must have studied this.
8:16
This is an equation of a line on a two dimensional space.
8:21
So this is the bit.
8:27
Yeah, so this or this, this is the same thing is a line.
8:33
In. In two dimensional. And so I'm.
8:44
Using art, too. So this is the geometric interpretation, but this is linear algebra, algebra.
8:51
So we stick to equations, but we keep jumping to the geometric interpretation.
8:58
Once in a while, it will be different, but mainly we focus on the equations.
9:03
All right, so. Yes, the word line and yours, this is where the term linear is being used in this and in the linear equation,
9:11
the word linear in linear equations comes from this example.
9:25
This way there are two variables and one equation.
9:29
It represents a line, and that's why it's being called linear nuts.
9:37
Funny thing when you change and.
9:42
To be three. Let em be three.
9:48
There are three unknowns or three variables and one equation. Let's take an example again X Plus.
9:57
Two Y plus three Z equals four.
10:07
OK. When it becomes three unknowns, you can again rewrite this as X is equal to four minus the Y minus three is A and B.
10:14
These all variables ask three variables.
10:30
They're both free to vary. And an ex would be dependent on on these pretty variables.
10:34
This domestically, this equation, domestically, it represents.
10:49
A plane. In a three dimensional space.
10:55
But. Now, see, it's this only when is it going to do you get a line?
11:07
And that name stuck around as linear equation equals three and equals four.
11:16
You don't have a line. It's a space which is very different from line,
11:22
but there's an underlying structure to all these do the line to the plane in a higher and three dimensional space,
11:27
to a three dimensional space in a four dimensional space.
11:35
The underlying structure is what we are referring to as linear, not the line.
11:39
Although the name has come from the line, but the the the structure is what we are referring to as linear.
11:44
OK, so one equation? Very easy to solve.
11:53
Basically, as if there's one equation and one unknown, there's a solution that is always a unique search.
11:58
If there's one equation, two unknowns. You get a line, if there's one equation and three unknowns,
12:08
we get a plane basically when any end is greater than one, we're getting infinitely many solutions.
12:16
All right. So keep that in mind, so I I think I should write that so that because at the end of this talk, we'll come back to that.
12:24
So. Where's is the pen?
12:36
One equation. One unknown.
12:46
One unique. Solution.
12:53
One equation. Two or more unknowns?
13:00
Infinitely many solutions in the best case, they will always be.
13:11
They can always be a situation like, for instance. No, not in this case, so infinitely many solutions.
13:16
I leave it at that for now. OK.
13:26
This was easy. Now let's. Let's look at the same problem from an adult perspective.
13:31
Let's have just one unknown. But two ways it's. OK.
13:39
And it's. Moving everything up for.
13:45
OK, so we now have we now look at the example of.
13:58
Two equations, all linear equations with just one unknown, and they need to be different.
14:05
Like the two equations cannot be both the same equations.
14:11
All right, so let's see. Three X equals one and four X equals two.
14:15
All right. Two equations, one unknown. Does this system now we call this a system of linear equations that all linear equations.
14:31
Does this have a solution? No, no. Because X cannot be bought one by three and one by two.
14:45
So no solution. OK. So we had either one unique solution in find agreement, any solutions or no solution,
14:57
depending on the number of equations that you have and the number of variables that you have.
15:10
All right. All these examples were easy.
15:16
Now we are going to move on to. But take care once.
15:20
Let's go to. Two equations and two unknowns.
15:27
I come up with an example, X plus two Y equals three.
15:39
And. Board X Plus Y Y equals six.
15:48
All would you so the system of two equations, tooling and equations the two unlocks.
15:57
What is this? It's a very standard technique which everyone has to be doing,
16:07
which would be use one equation to get one variable as a function of the three variables and substitute that in the other equation.
16:11
How would you write that basically? Oh, I can I can use the first equation.
16:26
OK. From the first equation. I say X is.
16:35
Three minus two, right? OK. And I substitute this over a year.
16:44
That is the standard technique which you have been used to in high school or anybody.
16:53
This is basically what anybody would do. OK. And when you substitute, you'll get four times three minus two 2Y.
16:59
Plus, y y equals six.
17:11
And this is basically let's get.
17:16
This comes this and then this becomes well minus eight y plus y y equals six, which is.
17:23
Which is minus three, why would I just jump?
17:44
Y is equal to minus six divided by minus three, right?
17:52
To. And then you go back. You use this tool in the first equation.
18:00
You basically use this tool. Oil and gas developments.
18:07
What was the what was it that we were using when we were using was we were using one equation
18:15
eliminate one of the variables from the next equation because see or hear this equation.
18:23
Has to come from this equation. And you have you have eliminated X.
18:30
So remember the world we are eliminating. A variable rate from one equation.
18:38
And this is all the guys in elimination technique, which is very,
18:46
very core to linear algebra is being used will be you will be doing that and that's your assignment
18:52
includes a lot of such problems which involve guys in elimination technique to get the solution.
19:01
OK. The way I've done it is very unorganised and it doesn't doesn't look systematic, but you can make it systematic or more more like algorithmic.
19:08
If you follow what we call draw operations.
19:26
So I again solve the same problem. With.
19:34
So what were it was X plus two Y equals three and.
19:47
X plus y y equals six.
19:55
All right. So all the idea is the idea is to first get rid of this dump dome, this this variable in the equation.
20:01
So how can I do that? I can multiply the first equation or I'll aisle because these these equations will be called rules.
20:14
OK, so I'll call this as my rule one.
20:24
And this is my rule, too. So.
20:28
So the first step would be to get rid of this vortex dome in the second row or in the second equation.
20:33
I will multiply the first dome by four and subtract it from the second.
20:44
So. R2 will be replaced by.
20:50
Are two minus four times odd one.
20:57
That is the raw patient agreement. And what do we get?
21:03
The new are to. The new two will now be now looks like this.
21:10
It is a fence, it keeps disappearing. OK.
21:25
The new idea will look like Z. It will be zero or zero.
21:29
I should have written the whole thing. 4X minus 4x would be the first on.
21:41
And then the second dome would be five white, minus four times two way, which is eight way.
21:51
And then this will be six minus four times three, which is 12. We did it's the same thing.
22:04
What we did, but this is more systematic, this is our computers.
22:10
They do such raw operations to compute the solution of system of linear equations.
22:14
And I have not used the word matrix yet, but that is the matrix in there.
22:20
All right. And everything's in there, but it's important that we know that.
22:25
What when we are doing those matrix operations and they are essentially solving the system of linear equations,
22:32
which we'll study in in the coming weeks?
22:42
All right. So. So this becomes zero x or zero.
22:47
Plus, minus three y equals minus six, and then you simplify this further,
22:56
you get why it was two and then plug it back in the first equation and you will get X equals minus one.
23:03
OK. Simple technique, basically, just to get it, just to eliminate a variable.
23:19
Now let's. Look at. Let's look at two equations with three variables.
23:27
We now have two equations, but with three unknowns are three variables.
23:43
So it can be. X plus two y plus three Z equals four and five x plus six y plus seven z equals eight.
23:53
Again, the approach is similar. But this time.
24:15
You will have a free variable, you won't be able to get a unique solution.
24:21
How would we do that? We would again, which it operation would you carry?
24:26
Would you do to? Getting a solution, what what operation can you do to get rid of this storm way?
24:33
Anyone? T minus minus five to one.
24:44
You're right. So I'll replace row two as row two minus five times row one.
24:49
And when you do that, you will get. When you do that, your role too becomes.
25:00
Six y minus 10 y, so if we become minus four Y.
25:15
And seven z minus 15 Z, which will become minus eight Z and eight minus 20, which will be minus 12.
25:21
Right, this will be my second, this is what the second equation will look like after this operation.
25:35
But he does that there are two variables now, so you don't have a unique solution, you can't have a unique solution.
25:44
One of them has to become a free variable.
25:51
Just the way we encountered every variable in one equation with unknowns and one in which we are not similarly or you're.
25:55
One has to be a free variable to make a choice. You can choose that you can choose right to be the free variable or say it depends.
26:05
What is more convenient? So I choose, why do I choose data with the previous debate so this thing can be rewritten as?
26:16
Y equals. And Z minus 12 divided by four, which is same as A to Z minus three.
26:33
So. That is not a free variable.
26:47
Why depends on Zed as to Z minus the function of say?
26:53
And then when you plug this, why? Or you you're.
27:00
OK. You can get X as another function of Z.
27:07
Another linear function of yes, exactly. Sorry.
27:13
So the same thing. Oh, yeah, there's a minus four in the right, so it will be minus two plus z plus the.
27:19
There was a small typo, I have corrected that.
27:36
OK. The basic idea is that when you have two equations and three unknowns, one unknown ends up being a free variable.
27:42
Of course, they should be linearly independent. I mean, this is something we learn in the coming weeks.
27:51
So one very variable and then you get infinitely many solutions because that's pretty variable can impact human events and accordingly,
28:02
you'll get the value for it, X and Y.
28:10
All right. So.
28:17
After all this, you can start playing around, you can play around with different kinds of matrices.
28:22
No, I'm saying I shouldn't use that word as yet because I'm not going to say you can play
28:30
around with different dimensions of the system of linear equations you can have.
28:34
Three, three equations with three unknowns, three equations and four unknowns for equations with three unknowns.
28:43
I play around and see what you get. This is how you develop, and you should know what is really happening behind.
28:49
Right before I really go on to make the season two more to those terms,
28:57
I said I would suggest that you play around with different kinds of equations, with the system of linear equations and see what is happening.
29:03
One thing that is happening is you either get. No solution.
29:17
Or you get one unique solution. All you get infinitely many solutions.
29:26
But you never get to a solution, not a solution, not for solutions. But can anyone prove why is that why that cannot happen?
29:39
Chris, you have two different solutions. These are a combination of those solutions will also be a solution.
29:54
Exactly. This is this can be a kind of one man.
30:02
And the idea is very simple. So suppose you have two solutions you assume.
30:08
Let's assume that there are some there is some system of linear equations which has exactly two solutions or assume.
30:14
Two unique. Solutions.
30:26
All right, let's call them. X1. And the notations went in will get mixed up.
30:32
OK, let me use some other notation. I assume there are two unique solutions, say we one.
30:43
And we do they are unique. They are different. They are not equal. They are.
30:52
All you need to do is prove that we won. Plus we do.
30:57
Divided by two is also a solution, and that's your assumption that they were there are only only two unique solution is false.
31:03
Right. And it applies for any and we're going to generalise it for any other than one.
31:16
And that's it. Yeah, so far.
31:22
This looks great now. I would am I running out of time?
31:30
No, Panopto. So now let me then.
31:36
The gender informal system of linear equations.
31:48
So let's say there are. M equations m linear.
31:53
M, linear equations. And an unknown site invaded was.
32:04
Then it looks something like. A one one.
32:21
It's one plus eight, one two.
32:27
X2 plus dot, dot dot.
32:33
Less A1 and in.
32:37
Is he going to be one? Then the second equation would look like a two one x one plus eight two two x two plus, no doubt.
32:42
And to an extent, equals B do.
32:58
This way, you have any number of equations of a m one x one plus eight m two x two plus dot dot dot.
33:04
E M and S N is going to be.
33:20
Any. Now, this was a lot of it takes a lot of effort to write the not so many equations and so many unknowns, and it gets a little clumsy.
33:27
So, so to make it more compact and more easy.
33:43
Mathematicians came up with a simple technique, which is. They define what we call matrices.
33:48
A very simple technique. Man, I represent the coefficients.
33:59
As ends in a rectangular matrix of size MRI and so the coefficients.
34:07
Now and these in this rectangular.
34:17
Object. A one one, a one two, about the top one in.
34:25
Dot dot dot a m one. And to.
34:34
And. And the.
34:41
Variables. They are all the same.
34:48
And that's what we are saving when we lie in this compact combat, we need not repeat deadly right the same variables again and again.
34:52
This variable is written in the column form.
35:00
X1 X2. And.
35:06
This is equal to. The constant.
35:14
These constraints. B1 B2.
35:23
B and. Now in.
35:30
Later in the coming lectures. Oops!
35:37
Why is this? In the coming lectures, we will play with these entities.
35:43
This is called a matrix, in particular, this is the coefficient matrix.
35:51
This is the victor on the variable victor or the variable.
36:04
I mean, I can do not I can I use that notation for these, for these?
36:11
I simply call this matrix eight. I call this Mr. X.
36:23
I use an arrow just to indicate that this is a vector and not a not a single variable.
36:30
But as you get familiar with this concept of vectors and made this season, we can get rid of the arrow on top of excess that.
36:36
And this is equal to. The rest to be.
36:48
Yeah, and in the next lecture, it will be all about Matrix,
36:57
make them like duplication and matrix matrix multiplication and doing the same Gaussian elimination procedure.
37:03
But this time on matrices. And we'll also realise that when we do that, we can also compute the inverse of the matrix with the same bit.
37:13
So all this in the next lecture? That's it for today.
37:25
Any questions? Yes. Is there a difference between that that's just and or on The Matrix or no?
37:29
Basically, a vector is my one matrix that you can think.
37:42
So, yeah, I should mention the dimensions yet. So this is an mbye and matrix.
37:49
This is this vector is an end by one matrix.
37:55
And this isn't my one. But we still use the word vector because it has it plays a very important role, which is very different from other matrices.
38:02
We look at matrices as entities which transform the way.
38:15
And that's the reason why we use a different word for that.
38:20
There's a vector, there's a point in space and that point in space is getting transformed or moved by this matrix.
38:25
So that's why there are two words. Yeah. Any more questions in the chat?
38:36
Yes, it seems there. Yes, there are no pre-recorded videos because I have not recorded them as yet, so I'll upload that soon.
38:42
Yeah, because this is not difficult, that's because this is the first week and I have to take, I have to bring everyone on board.
38:58
There are some students who have not seen this before now.
39:09
All right. No problem. There's some messages that were meant to be private, but they were there.
39:23
No problem, not no issues at all. OK, thank you, everyone.
39:31
I'll see you next week and I'll upload a few videos in there for you to watch.
39:35
All right, thank you. Bye bye. Thank you.
39:41
So we're looking to get a picture.
39:49
