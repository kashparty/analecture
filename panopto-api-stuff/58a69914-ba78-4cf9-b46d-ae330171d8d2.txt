Title: Happy Dragons - Stylised Proof
Category: 0 - Proof styles
Lecturer: Mark Wheelhouse
Date: 21/01/2021
Cool. Welcome back. From that, look at a bit of a chance to discuss this in your breakout areas.
0:01
So before I showed you how this looked in natural deduction style, it was quite a long and hairy process.
0:06
So let's see how this would look. Kind of following the life style that we're gonna be trying to use on cutting to use more in this course.
0:14
So let's look at the problem we got. We got our given's. One, two, three, four, five.
0:22
And we've got our goal. What we trying to show so better, trying to show that every green dragon is happy.
0:29
That makes sense. So as often with these kind of stars.
0:35
I always tried it myself, kind of gold drippings. I find that they're going to try and write the smallest, neatest proof possible.
0:39
It helps to be targeting exactly what you need to prove. Going to start forward first and breaking the PA.
0:44
Then you often end up having a lot more pieces maybe you need later on to combine.
0:50
So here I look at the show and it's the fragile X and then some property inside the
0:54
contemplation that tells me the first thing I to do is to take an arbitrary value X.
0:59
So let's take arbitrary. Obstructing the moment, and that's called it smell.
1:05
Why not? Living finds out that. So let's make some assumptions.
1:13
Then from this. So our assumption, number one,
1:19
because this thing is it is a chain of implications that the others that's somehow some cancer about how this works or you read these things.
1:22
Right. Associative. It comes out like this, a standard convention in logic.
1:30
And it's the same as saying that every drug in its green is also then happy.
1:35
So Dugin X and Green X implies happy X with another way of bitterness.
1:40
This that makes sense. And I think that's the best translation from the it meaningless.
1:45
So our first option is going to be taking a drug in the one most. Element of this chain.
1:48
So assume that smile with a dragon and then the next thing that then breaks down into
1:57
it kind of gets rid of the publication and we're left then with Greenup's in place,
2:02
happy ex to show. So that same same process once I can now assume that we have green.
2:07
Smiles, no, no smile is just a name. It's not actually the real smile from from the TV series or the films because it's actually a Red Dragon.
2:16
But that's not important, which is an assumption is usually constant. So now we need to show.
2:24
Smile is happy. So how we gonna do this thing?
2:32
So this is where we can start to apply some more of the techniques of kind of the stylised proof reasoning rather than kind of going after stock.
2:39
It just doesn't done. Now, you look at it, say, I can. I've got happy. What do I do?
2:48
And I mean, regardless of how we approach it from that point of view, we're gonna see the only way to get to happy is here.
2:53
And I'll give them no one. There's not nothing else to ever deduce happiness for us in this kind of set of rules that we've been given.
2:59
So I'm gonna have to try and use this first one.
3:06
And then you might start randomly combining things on those I mean, green some dragons there might be around such.
3:11
What we are trying to do here is look at the structure of what we've got and try and plan from that.
3:14
So in particular, one tells me that I basically need to get my dragon and all the dragons children can fly and then the dragon will be happy.
3:20
So using that, then we can look at things that, well, how are we going to work this out?
3:30
Well, we know that flying Ogie dragons can fly.
3:35
That's number two. Number three tells us that if your parents green than your green four tells us that
3:38
if you are the child of a dragon and you're a dragon as well as the kind of green,
3:46
this dragon, this are inherited properties and their five loves to flip between the child on parents of assertion is the way that we got down here.
3:51
So what I really want to do is get to a point where I can show that all the children of smell are going to be green.
4:00
They're going to be dragons. And they're not gonna work out. They're going to fly.
4:07
But rather than breaking that down to small pieces, I'm gonna try and do it, maintaining the structure as many properties as possible.
4:09
So first things first. What I don't really want to have to deal with.
4:16
Is kind of the two things that line three has a slightly different format.
4:23
How many exists in here, which is not super helpful to me, I think. And the other thing is that I've also got two notions of inheritance.
4:27
I've got one set of rules that are written with parents and one set of rules with children.
4:36
And I think it's much easier to kind of normalise. That's what they do first. To help normalise my given.
4:41
So they're a bit more useful to me going forward.
4:46
So I mean by that is I'm going to say, well, let's convert line three so that we can move the existence further, further out.
4:50
So it's more of a form of having lots of rules in the outside talking to to use for elimination more easily.
4:59
Swanger do there is say well for all X. Why?
5:04
Parent of one X. And.
5:13
Green why implies. Darkness much from.
5:19
Free. So all I'm doing there is I'm using an equivalence to move my quantification business application further out.
5:27
So that's a pretty standard governance contract. You've got the exists something with an application like this I can convert that exist
5:34
to a roll outside and end up with a slightly more normal form expression of this thing.
5:42
That makes sense. And, you know, if you're worried about that, you prefer to go away and prove that that property works.
5:48
Maybe an introduction or a separate subgroups of them if you really want to go right. And do that.
5:54
That's one step. Then I want to get the step where I'm going to normalise now.
5:59
So this thing is still in terms of parents are really what I'm choosing to write everything in terms
6:03
of children's blank and proceed so I can so I can take Rolex through why I can use rule five.
6:08
Upon here's to use the line six I've just written. And the rule five, I give them to rewrite this in terms of parents.
6:15
So children sign. So I had parents of White X, which is the same as child of X Y.
6:24
That's what it said. By line five. And still green, why implies.
6:31
Green eggs. So just be writing things into a slightly more normal form.
6:42
Now, here's what we hoped. We were going to make some gains on my plate. Plan now is to reuse this,
6:47
to use the property now established to be able to establish properties about small children
6:52
without having to unpack everything all the way down to finding a particular concrete child.
6:58
So you saw in the previous there's no doubt about that, because I, I basically have smelled and then halfway down the proof here,
7:04
I have to have another constant to consider whether a particular child of Smout Miracle Drogon.
7:11
And it's not quite technically correct, but it's going to concrete example. And then I can use that one child evidence.
7:18
That's what they do here. Instead, it's reason more abstractly at the level of all of Smaltz children.
7:23
So how do you do that? And I say, well. What I've got next of all, let's talk about the colours now.
7:30
Should say for all X. We can write.
7:37
Child of. Ex. Smiled.
7:43
Implies. Green tax. I'm doing that by using line seven.
7:50
I just used so say, whenever I have a child and it's green.
8:01
Turn to the parent greens that she Warren.
8:07
Lockhart Gardner. Simone. Yeah. So whenever I'm a child or something that was green, I am green.
8:13
So here I am saying, well, in that case, whenever you are the child of smell, then you are green.
8:16
And that follows from that. But I know that every child of green thing is also green.
8:21
And the smell was green because that's our assumption. Number two.
8:25
So rather than break it down to the base elements, I'm kind of doing an implied substitution.
8:32
Slightly more clever substitution of things. And similarly, energy, the same thing for knowing about dragons.
8:37
Right. So I said whenever I had a child. Of. Of X smiled.
8:43
So whenever the child is smiled, that means that X is a dragon.
8:51
Similar, that's by using one about given rules before.
8:59
And our assumption. The smugglers, the target, which is up here to something very important for us.
9:04
So now I know the order Snout's children agree in all of Smaltz children's dragons.
9:10
So I need to, I guess, officially kind of write that as a clear. We're also going to say, well, for all X.
9:15
Child of. X smiled. Implies.
9:22
If I can x and. Green X.
9:29
That's following from lines nine. And eight.
9:35
So just basically using saying, well, I know the older child is now green. I know that all the children of smell are dragons.
9:43
So therefore, I should get to do it. All the children all smoke, all green dragons. Well, it seems logical.
9:50
Again, if you're worried about that, feel free.
9:54
You can go and do the proof that A implies B and A imply C means that A implies B and C shouldn't be too surprising, hopefully.
9:56
But again, if you're concerned enough about doing these studies,
10:03
you can always go away and break into a proof you don't believe perhaps and see it working in practise.
10:07
Well, I didn't wait. So then now I know the order smokes children up at Green Dragons.
10:12
So then using RU two. Now, if something is green, a dragon, it can fly.
10:18
So again, I'm going in place. Change this. I never had to break inside of this fruit in some sense.
10:24
I've never had to say, well, give me a particular child to smell. I can do this with acquaintances, high level.
10:31
So as a child of X. Smell implies.
10:37
Floyd ex. That comes from the line 10 that we just deduced.
10:43
And rule number two, that we have it beginning. And then from this, I've now got something that says all extortive.
10:51
I smell fly, which is exactly the same format as this point here, Mudgett.
11:00
OK, I need to rename X Y, but that's not important style for conversion on the bound variable.
11:05
So this tells me at this point I can deduce. Point twelve.
11:10
So happy. Smile will now hold its followers from.
11:14
Ruin of a one. And to kind of to dispatch the left hand side of the indication, I had assumption, one that told me that smile was a dragon.
11:26
And I have like a love him that handles the entire second consumption's.
11:36
Entire case here is handled by. And I've just proven and then lost Lundestad sets at the end of another space on my slide.
11:39
If thus. Alpha. Hold's.
11:46
And that's from. Assumption one.
11:52
Assumption to. Twelve. And very importantly, that smell.
11:57
Was an arbitrary choice of tracking back. Right. This first line.
12:04
You see that? That's it. Done. It's about ten lines of proof. And because it didn't have to break inside this quantifier here.
12:10
But all this work here on these lines never has to break inside that rule because we can just work at a
12:19
higher level of thinking by rewriting that kind of information we are given in terms of equivalences.
12:24
And that allows us to come to the proof. I think more intuitively,
12:31
but I've shown here that the reason why this works is because all the all the small children about green and dragons and therefore they can fly.
12:34
I think that brings up the intuition of why the properties hold the gamut.
12:41
I would I would argue that none of that is at all clear from this natural deduction proof up here.
12:44
So are we basically hearing yet?
12:51
So kind of are we basically replacing the assumption that we have a child or smoke with a chain of implication?
12:57
Kind of. Yeah, effectively, yeah.
13:07
So so what I'm doing. If you're doing it, that's a style I would have to kind of break down if you see it's out there.
13:11
But here I kind of break down to having a particular drag child and that
13:17
particular one child being the evidence that allows me because I choose arbitrary.
13:22
That's the evidence that allows it to rebuild kind of the implication stuff.
13:25
But what I do here is I think Huggett agrees that the clever rewriting of that saying, well,
13:28
I got the green here and the dragging here and then the dragging and the green here and in the flies,
13:35
I directly build this entire kind of predicate right here.
13:39
So I formed some formula here and I can't do that. Not adduction, right?
13:46
Not really. Not without break it down to smooth elements to prove. That's right.
13:49
So if I do it here in terms of rewrite taking the given's I've got here because I'm not in a great format.
13:52
Right. They've got convocations and all the places and they've got that the child of the pen of differences as well,
13:59
which comes from just translating the English language statements directly by baby whiteners little bit, which is what I'm doing up here.
14:04
The first three lines is all about rewriting these things to get into a nice format that I can then do in place.
14:10
Equivalences to get this sub formula more directly than I would get it right after such.
14:15
I think that's where the winning I'm using the fact that I'm human.
14:22
I can think more intuitive on the computer to apply higher tuition to higher thinking to this particular problem here.
14:24
And I hope that the intuition of Whitehall's comes out more clearly than it doesn't have adoption as well.
14:32
So I don't want to much longer term, whether we're nearly out of time,
14:37
if we have a couple seconds to go and go away and have a break before, whether you have after this, hopefully find that interesting.
14:41
I will put up the full notes for this in a few moments. And that will mean that you can see this, that there's a bit more discussion about this.
14:46
This are proof in the form notes in particular. Some people on the call might be thinking, I'm not reconvince by step six,
14:54
seven and 10, which I've done some of these slightly more high level thinking steps.
15:01
That's absolutely fine. I've proven each of those steps in turn inside the footnotes as well.
15:06
Just in case you don't believe me, really, we could guarantee you they are completely correct. And that's, again, the benefit of doing it this way.
15:14
If someone does disagree with a particular step, you can always take that step and do it.
15:19
Sub Lemmer proof to show that I read a hold in general if you want to kind of guarantee that would be incorrect.
15:22
So that allows you to tailor your level of presentation to the the understanding the audience.
15:28
If that makes sense. So I'll leave you there. You should find that tomorrow morning.
15:32
Every Friday morning. The tutorial sample answers for the week that we run through.
15:35
We'll be available to you on Caite under the G button.
15:40
The given files, there'll be a sample at the bottom. There you'll find the PM Teague sample.
15:44
Answers are released every, I think, Monday on Caite for the preceding week just to make sure we have time to discuss them with your PMC group.
15:49
It an asset PMC. It's usually about the following Wednesday,
15:57
but it's just to make sure there's talk to someone on embracement relates to not have the time support to them.
15:59
So hopefully that's good. I'll leave that and look forward to seeing you next week in the discussion.
16:04
There'll be a post on Piazza a weekend or early on Monday explaining exactly what videos to watch from that's week and otherwise.
16:09
See that. Have a good weekend and enjoy the rest of the week.
16:15
So. Thank you.
16:19
