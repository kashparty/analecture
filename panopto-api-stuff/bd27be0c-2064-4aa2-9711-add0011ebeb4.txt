Title: L06-L07 - Live Q&A (part 1)
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova
Date: 29/10/2021
So welcome once again, hopefully you had access to all the materials, as some of you saw,
0:03
I think there were some problems with Seigenthaler or the files were corrupted.
0:12
So we have to rebuild all of them also. Now, you should have access to every single lecture of the course.
0:17
Be aware that some of the slides and notes might change until the lecturer and until the week of the election actually happens.
0:25
But those changes will not be large ones.
0:36
Also, before we start with a Q and A, please stick around for the tutorial,
0:41
because this tutorial is you will see very nicely related to the coursework that starts this week.
0:46
Also, remember that the coursework number one and you have one more, which I cannot remember.
0:56
Now, let me pick it up. I think you have to sum either by the end of this week or by the end of next week.
1:05
So keep that in mind. And you should have that available in Incat, which should give you that month,
1:12
saw that this week we're going to be starting also of work a number two and there's going to be this one week of oh, OK.
1:24
So let's get started with the questions.
1:32
I don't know if you have any questions for the two lectures that we have this week, which are, remember, lecture six and seven.
1:34
So. Let me check on the.
1:46
Participial is there, and if anyone wants to ask any questions, please just speak up on this.
1:52
There's lots of you. Just go ahead.
1:57
Should I be taking that as a no questions?
2:09
I hope it means because everything was clear, I hope it's not because you were unable to access the materials in time for.
2:14
A lot of questions, I got to say that from previous years, lecture number seven is usually one that some of you struggle a bit,
2:32
but in your mind around how this time dependent state transitions work, but hopefully after today's tutorial, that will be very clear.
2:46
And then, of course, work number two is going to basically boil down to those concepts when when you do the exercises on your own to.
2:58
OK, so. Let's see, OK, I see there's one.
3:16
Yeah, OK, of hapless. Can you go through the reports, I think it was the beginning of the second part of the topic seven lecture.
3:21
Uh, it was about something like the relation between the voltage outputs and voltage inputs.
3:32
I don't really think I'm quite understanding that graph. Can you go through it again?
3:39
OK, let me share the screen. There we go.
3:43
First is this lecture number seven? Yes, it is.
3:50
And you're talking about the aspects of things that you have to just posit.
3:54
This one, the one. The next slide. Basically, yeah.
4:00
This one. Yeah. I don't I can't explain the voltage outputs and voltage inputs relation again.
4:04
I don't think I can quite getting it. So this is a model that we are really not going to be using for exercises,
4:10
but it's a much more close to the physics model, even though it's not 100 percent accurate.
4:20
And it's how are we going to how we can interpret the way in which the output voltage is going to change based on the input voltage.
4:29
So basically what we're saying here is that. Eventually, over time.
4:40
Voltages are going to stabilise on Ondes Netherland because, sure, there's going to be a switching, but according to this model,
4:48
the switching is going to converge to an intermediate point that so happens to be outside the thresholds that we set in in previous light.
4:58
I remember it was sort of her unthaw limit and.
5:06
Yeah, it that we set here like the zero point five.
5:17
If I remember correctly, OK, we said here, for example, is this noise margin aspect that we talked about,
5:22
like anything above three point five is going to be we are going to interpret as one anything below zero point three.
5:30
We are going to interpret that zero. And everything in between those two voltages is just something that we don't know.
5:37
So we basically want to have them well separated so that any noise which will exist in our secret,
5:45
there's going to be plenty of noise is so well separated that we can be very sure we know it's either one or zero.
5:52
And therefore, even according to the variable resistor model here,
6:00
what happens is what it tells us is that it's going to converge eventually to this one point, two volt.
6:06
Which is nothing, it means like we just don't know what it is.
6:13
Don't worry about it.
6:18
This is really more about letting you know of the existence of them rather than something that we are going to be really focussing on.
6:19
Because this is basically a model that is models based on the underlying physics
6:30
of of the of the circuit and that set these margins that I was talking about,
6:39
they are important. So if we look at one of the previous graphs here of transitions.
6:46
The reason why we need to wait from the point in which a change is,
6:54
let's say we want to start changing our value until we consider it changed, is because.
7:01
And as we wait for the signal to propagate the voltages to propagate through the circuit,
7:09
we might be measuring something that is in between and we don't really know what it what it is.
7:14
It's still transitioning. The coral is still propagating through a circuit with changes that we had on the inputs.
7:19
So that's why we have this time deltas in in our circuits.
7:25
And that is why these essentially at the end of the day limits a lot of how fast we can make our secrets go.
7:32
Wait, so can I understand that gruff, I said I say depiction of the times you like section of this of this graph here.
7:44
Yeah, like the time delay section. So basically the previous the previous graph is a depiction of the Times of Excession.
7:52
The previous graph. You mean the other one that we were looking at. Yeah, yeah.
8:01
Yeah. So this is kind of a more this is more easily understandable.
8:05
And in many times if you are analysing a circuit, a low level, you will see this type of time diagrams, even though in this case we try to the them.
8:11
So usually you will see this where you just have square signals because this is the easiest way to think about it.
8:24
Like, I know that after a certain time I will have a new signal.
8:30
And it's in this case, it's going to the output is going to go from one to zero.
8:34
That's the more abstract model in switch. And.
8:38
Now, what happens in reality is something closer to these where lines are not square signals.
8:42
They are this smooth wave that changes over time.
8:49
And therefore, we do need to wait, not only because the signal is going to appear later,
8:56
but also because it's going to be transitioning until that time. Right.
9:02
Cool. A lot of what is the T stands for Time Delta.
9:06
OK, thank you. Oh, and by restart time, like a little bit after we have started increasing the world, but they might not exactly at that point.
9:15
So you're talking about this one graph here. I know the graph.
9:29
Mm hmm. And why restart time after labour delay and not OK.
9:34
So remember, we said in a previous light that we are going to consider that the signal is a one once.
9:42
It is a volf, one revolt's.
9:48
That's why there's this like you just remember above, one point three is one below zero point three, which should be somewhere around here is zero.
9:52
And anything in between is is noise. It's like it's it's it's completely useless and anything in between.
10:01
And again, even this model that is more complicated than the previous one,
10:11
this is also a simplification because it's not that t these starts here because the signal will start propagating as soon as there is a change,
10:15
like the signal is always propagating. It's a continuous stream.
10:24
It's like you can think of it like a faucet of water. So the water is always running if you keep the faucet, always at the same.
10:28
Throughput. Water is always running, it's just the throughput doesn't change.
10:39
Now, once we start closing it or opening it more, that change is going to propagate over time.
10:43
That's exactly how the circuit is behaving with current.
10:49
It just that looking at it at this very low level, it's just too complicated and it's not that useful for us.
10:55
So it's not worth the effort, really. Unless, well, there's some weird things we want to look at,
11:04
like why is this happening so that we can explain why this switch and delay model makes sense and in fact,
11:11
these very specific circuit that has a back,
11:20
we will see in the next week that it actually is a building block for something very important, which is basically memory.
11:23
Memory is a is a is a closed loop. And that's how we maintain data, basically because we keep a voltage that is either one or zero.
11:31
We keep it circling around and then we have to do certain things to make sure it stays there.
11:42
But you will see all of these in next week. Let's not talk about it right now.
11:48
So I the question about nominal sides of the case.
11:56
So how do we calculate that? I mean, all sizes you don't there's the table.
12:00
I don't remember if it's this flight deck or the or No.6.
12:09
So do we just remember the. I will I will give them to you.
12:14
I honestly believe that remembering these arbitrary numbers is doesn't make a lot of sense.
12:20
If you ever need them, you will have them available.
12:27
Either I will give them to you or you will be allowed to have a piece of paper with them.
12:31
OK, thank you very much, sir. And these are.
12:38
And he really arbitrary, this is an approximate relative size between them that kind of follows what happens in reality in the physical world.
12:45
So let me switch back to the lecture window in case I see.
13:00
Yeah, I see that there's moorhens k. Is this an old hand or an Afghan or another question.
13:06
OK, and I am. So I just ask my question or oh, yeah, sorry, go ahead.
13:12
I just wanted to know if the other one was also. No, go ahead.
13:21
Yeah. So, um, so regarding the circuit design, um, so whenever where we were to design circuits for,
13:25
let's say, a relation to, we always need to draw literals table and then use the came up.
13:33
Our story, like we have got a set of conditions and so given to any bull, any question,
13:41
do we always need to draw the truth table first, the map, every single value on the table to the climate and the right question?
13:49
Oh, that's a good question. The answer is, unless you're explicitly asked to do so, you don't need to.
13:56
But those are useful tools. If you follow them in order to arrive to a decent, relatively small circuit, you can do it.
14:05
Just go head first and do the final circuit from the textual description of it, but usually you will find that in exams and things like,
14:16
OK, go step by step, she'll show them to me, show that you can you know how to do each of the steps.
14:26
And that's the problem has got more complicated. You really do need to go through those steps.
14:34
Does that does that sort of question? I don't hear anything I don't know if you're talking or not.
14:42
OK, I'm going to if I have some internal problem now or are you OK or having it?
15:00
You know, I got here my. OK, maybe I am back now.
15:12
So heavy. Well, yeah, I can hear you.
15:20
I cannot see your guy, though, so maybe I have some internal problems.
15:24
OK, so he's not going to. So, OK, let's go to our next question and thank you.
15:31
Hi. Yeah, in like seven Slate six, could you explain why increasing into voltage decreases the output voltage slide six.
15:40
In this one. Yeah. OK, and the question is why increasing input for those decreases output voltage this OK, this is so.
15:57
I think that you had some basic notion of circuit analysis, like electric circuit analysis before coming to a uni, and that's where it's coming from.
16:13
There's like a very quick reminder here in terms of formulas in those lives.
16:27
The reason is you apply the formulas and then and then that's the result that comes out of this specific circuit.
16:33
And that's all the things that you studied in regards to parallel and serial circuits.
16:42
There's a very sharp reminder. I cannot remember exactly which light here, but we used this a few formulas here.
16:52
That's exactly where it's coming from. To be honest, this is so that you understand how it connects to physical circuits like electric circuits.
16:59
How. This is connected to the digital circuits that we are building so that you see
17:14
how things go down the line and eventually reduce electrons and current flows.
17:21
Remember that like that transformation vote in the election.
17:27
But I can tell you now you will not be examined on circuits because that's that's not the purpose of this.
17:32
Of this, of course. It's the purpose of this course is not to learn how to calculate circuits and such.
17:42
It is necessary to know how that relationship works.
17:50
And, for example, it's an important thing if you later go on building circuits, you will find it.
17:54
But it's extremely important to know about the find out limitations that we were talking about at the end of this lecture.
17:59
Number seven, that the bigger you know, the more things you have connected to that, your output does lower.
18:09
It's going to be and also there's a limit to it. And if you are building circuits, you will have to work around this.
18:16
And that's something you can look into the future if you go beyond what we show here.
18:23
But for now, what's necessary is just to know that this link exists, roughly how and why it exists.
18:30
And what we want you to really know is how the logic aspect of it works and then
18:38
how we can build complex circuits and eventually processors using this knowledge.
18:44
Look at. So let me see if there's any other maybe there's some questions.
18:53
OK, I just saw your. No, I could not hear you.
19:06
I guess that that's how you know. Are there other questions?
19:10
Maybe we can do one more and then I think we can start at the Turrill.
19:16
OK, so no more questions. So, again, as a reminder, this to trial is, of course, of these two lectures, that of this week,
19:25
and it's going to be very helpful for you to solve it together in groups in order to later do coursework number two,
19:35
because it's basically the same type of things. Again, check the final four to see which group you should go to.
19:45
This week is going to be the same group this past week. So if you already remember just that, just one quick note.
19:54
If you go to your group and there's not a lot of people is if it's a less than four of you,
20:02
please feel free to shuffle and go to another group so that you can work together with more people.
20:09
If you would prefer to stay in a really, really small group that is fine by me.
20:16
Just know that if you would like to have more support with more of your peers, please move around if your group is already big enough.
20:20
Please do not move around because next week we are going to create new groups. So don't worry, you will you will get to know more of your peers.
20:29
So with that said, no, it's 11, 25.
20:37
I'm sorry yet. So let's say let's meet back here at 15 in.
20:44
To. Ten minutes past. So that we can all discuss if there's any points, other things that.
20:54
Are commonly asked during the editorial, we will keep an eye for it so that we can talk about them together,
21:08
or also if you there's new questions that pop up as they're doing the tutorial and you want us and we will have time for that.
21:14
So let's look at two of them together here in the general channel.
21:20
So, you know, I'm going to stop recording now. This time I will remember to the.
21:27
Go to Tostan.
21:33
