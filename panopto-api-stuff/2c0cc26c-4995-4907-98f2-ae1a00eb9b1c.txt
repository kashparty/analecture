Title: Artefact ACI Talk Jan 2022
Category: Applications of Computing in Industry (ACI) Talks
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 11/01/2022
OK, so welcome, everybody got and this is the AC I took the applications of competing in an industry talk by artefacts who are going
0:03
to tell us something very interesting about how data science can be used to drive strategic marketing decisions.
0:14
And our speaker is Dan Howard Stern. Please take the away goal.
0:24
Thank you very much for the for the introduction, guys. Just a quick check that we have one hour today till 14:00.
0:29
Yeah, I mean, if you can do sort of 35 40 minutes of talking, then we can, then we can have some Q&A.
0:36
Yeah, yeah, that's that's normally how we do it.
0:46
I think it's a good it's good to have some interaction and stuff at the end, if we can.
0:50
Most def. Yeah, OK, thanks. Take it away. Thanks so much. Cool.
0:55
Thank you very much. So yes. Hello, everyone. I'm Daniel and I am joined here with with Sasha, who is our managing data scientist here in London.
0:59
Artefact in London. And I'm a consultant here.
1:08
And today we'll be talking to you about how we use data science to drive strategic marketing decisions, specifically with with three use cases.
1:11
And so audience engine and marketing measurement tools as well.
1:19
So just taking a look at the agenda for today, I'd firstly like to introduce artefact, you know, introduce our company,
1:24
what we do at the high level and our story before diving into the case studies of how we actually apply data science techniques and tools in
1:31
industry today to give you a feel for what we do before touching on the application process and the profiles that we're really looking for.
1:39
Before leaving about 20 minutes, as mentioned at the end for Q&A.
1:48
So without further ado, artefacts, what do we do?
1:54
So we are a data consultancy, but we specialise in data marketing.
1:58
And yeah, when when I say data consultancy, we really do the whole end to end value proposition all the way from data capture
2:04
and management to actually building AI driven solutions using this data.
2:12
So I guess our offering is kind of threefold.
2:18
Firstly, we transform the data that we're given because as I'm sure you guys know, big data is big by definition and by name.
2:20
So clients have a vast amounts of data, but sometimes it's difficult for them to organise it in such a way that they can actually make sense of it.
2:28
So there's actually huge amounts of work to be done for big,
2:37
large scale clients in terms of organising their data and transforming this into a form that they can make sense of.
2:41
Then we're also able to to apply and build our own data based on solutions and to provide specific and granular
2:48
insights to feed into marketing strategies to optimise our client's marketing strategies continuously.
2:57
And our final pillar, which is specifically around digital marketing.
3:05
So we have a media activation branch globally, which actually optimises campaigns and campaign performance for our clients as well.
3:11
But the main focus of today, and definitely what Sasha and I do, is definitely towards the left hand side here.
3:21
So around the data transformation and data for marketing and sales.
3:26
So our story artefact was created in 2014, so relatively nascent it was initially little big data consultancy and Augusta Consulting.
3:32
And in 2016 we rebranded as Artefact with 100 consultants and data scientists and received fundraising to expand across all of Europe.
3:43
So Artefact was originally founded in Paris, and our headquarters are in Paris, France, at the moment.
3:54
And yet, with regards to Artefact London, our story is, you know,
4:00
we received or rather we we we joined with Matt Brewster to form the number one
4:04
European company focussed specifically on data driven services for marketing,
4:13
as well as expanding into China in 2018. And just recently, we received funding from Adeang, a big private equity firm, to further scale globally.
4:18
So where are we at the moment? Well, we're global. We've got offices in all the continents across the world,
4:33
and the UK office is one of the fastest growing and most profitable branches of artefacts worldwide.
4:39
But as mentioned, Francis is our headquarters at the moment.
4:46
We've also expanded into the US relatively recently, starting in New York as of the beginning of 2021,
4:49
and just recently we've opened up an office in the West Coast as well.
4:56
So, yes, I guess in summary, what are we we are marketing engineers working in hybrid teams,
5:04
so we make and consist of over 200 business consultants, 200 data scientists and software engineers and 300 digital experts across the world.
5:10
Some of our clients, so all our clients, in fact, sorry, are all lost scales of footsy 100 and S&P 500 firms.
5:24
As a nature of the consulting reviews, we want to ensure that we're really bringing value, adds some of the biggest players in all the spaces.
5:33
So as an example, you can see that we work across multiple different industries and are able to give this really consulting appetite.
5:41
For those of you who are interested in consulting work and a host of different industries and different different streams.
5:49
You know, we cover a lot of different verticals and horizontals, all with a focus on data and data marketing.
5:57
So before pushing on, maybe a little bit more about myself as well.
6:04
So I've been working since I joined artefacts last March for one client.
6:09
So Reckitt Benckiser, so the name may not ring a bell immediately, but I'm sure that brands will so that brands include Eric Vanish,
6:16
Carpet Cleaners, Finish Dishwasher Tablets, Nurofen, Gaby Scorn, Durex.
6:25
And so I've been working with the same clients since March,
6:31
and I guess that's a little bit of a prelude as to maybe what you can expect for working in.
6:35
Now, the way we really do things is that maybe in traditional consulting firms,
6:41
you work on multiple different projects throughout the year and kind of six week sprints
6:46
and you only kind of give strategic consulting advice and you're kind of in and out,
6:51
so to speak. Now here automatically kind of adopted a different approach because we obviously have a plethora of fantastic data scientists,
6:57
Alexandra or Sasha, to name one of them. And we really focus not only on the strategies of providing our clients with with decisions
7:06
and inputs and insights into how they should execute their marketing campaigns and strategy.
7:15
But also we show them how to do that and get involved in the implementation side as well.
7:20
Now some of you may be wondering, you know,
7:25
the big appeal of consulting is to work with loads of different clients and to kind of have this breadth of experience.
7:28
And I can tell you from personal experience that despite working with with one clients, since I've joined,
7:34
I've worked on several different projects and within those projects,
7:39
we've actually been able to expand the accounts and add separate innovations on the top.
7:43
So this is also very good for my personal experience.
7:47
Speaking from past experience as well, that you know,
7:51
you actually rather than just focus on the strategic elements of consulting and the strategic element of projects,
7:54
you actually get to take a product, you know, from kind of ideation all the way to industrialisation.
7:59
So that's a big, big benefit of working on that. And in terms of the experience that you get from it.
8:05
So yeah, that's that's also an introduction.
8:13
So without further ado, I would like to go into some of the case studies and some of the real life innovations that we've brought to our client,
8:16
specifically Reckitt Benckiser. So first and foremost, I'm going to chat to you guys about audience, engine or product, the audience engine.
8:25
So what is audience engine or rather what is the problem that we were really trying to solve when we rolled out audience engine?
8:37
So in a pre-digital world, so to speak. Marketing was very manual, and a lot of sense is it required a lot of research,
8:44
a lot of workshops and a lot of service things that could be quite difficult and incompetent to set up and quite costly at the same time.
8:52
But marketing has always been very, very profitable and beneficial because, you know, to understand your customer is a key way to to sell to them.
9:00
However, as we've moved into a more and more digital world and data has become more readily available,
9:09
there is an onus for companies to actually shift from a more manual or assumption based marketing here to a data driven approach.
9:15
So in this sense, we we proposed to Reckitt Benckiser B R R Innovation to essentially leverage the data that
9:25
they had access to in order to better target specific audiences for their campaigns.
9:33
So how how do we do this? Well, I mean, when we say data, the data comes in many different formats and hierarchy,
9:41
so to speak, so first party data being part of being data, that's our client actually owns.
9:49
So that's something that's on their websites. Second party data is through the partners that they or the partnerships that they have.
9:55
So, for instance, records our client will sell on on Amazon, and they have as a as a partnership,
10:01
they have access to the data that the Amazon data of all the customers that purchased through that platform.
10:08
And then this third party data as well, which is from open source and other sources as well.
10:14
So by leveraging all of these, three operating data, scientists were able to up and create what is known as the audience engine.
10:22
So what is the audience engine when we were pricing is what we wanted to really achieve.
10:32
Well, firstly, we wanted it, obviously to consolidate all the possible data sources that we had to ensure that we had a
10:36
comprehensive view and understanding of of purchasing patterns and what was going on in the market.
10:42
And so using the data science techniques,
10:50
the the idea behind audience mention was to have three key pillars of how we were actually going to provide value to records.
10:55
So they came back to us and they said, Well, we need something that can actually build audiences for us,
11:03
and we also need better tools to integrate these audiences into our product offering.
11:09
And come the end of it,
11:15
we actually need to generate insights as well to kind of feed in and provide the sort of feedback loop so they can continuously innovate,
11:16
improve and and obviously benefit their revenues and target the right customers.
11:23
And also, of course, what was important was to ensure this was all done in a seamless manner.
11:31
And so the use user face was also created for our clients to ensure that they
11:36
were able to access these insights and act upon them in with immediate effect.
11:42
So just to give you guys a little bit more of a feel, I'm not going to go too in-depth into each of the capabilities,
11:50
and I will share this deck with Tom, who I'm sure will send it to all of you after this as well.
11:56
But just to give you a bit of a feel of the actual capabilities of the audience engine.
12:02
So in terms of the audience building pillar, we have something called a propensity modelling, and its key output really is the seat audience.
12:06
So essentially schools all the different audiences into hot,
12:15
warm and cold segments based on their likelihood to convert and all the data that's been collected previously in terms of purchasing patterns.
12:19
So as an example, visitors are very likely to buy Lysol disinfectant sprays for visitors that are most likely to enrol to the newsletter or CRM.
12:28
And the key value add here is that now we're reaching 100 percent of websites audiences versus average retargeting audiences of around 20 percent.
12:36
So a big, big benefit there. And so that's been reflected in seen in terms of their marketing campaigns and the success of them.
12:44
Another one is is the community clustering one, which outputs something similar so that the seed audience as well.
12:53
But this time it's kind of named accordingly.
13:00
So we were able to sort of segment different customers into into into groups, so to speak, for example, environmentally conscious customers,
13:02
pet owners, fragrance freaks and struggling jugglers, some of the audiences that we've come up with as well.
13:11
And yes, and just touch on maybe the audience integration and audience insights capabilities as well.
13:19
So for audience integration, we have to look like modelling and affinity modelling,
13:26
which outputs activate full size party audiences as well for our clients to target in their campaigns.
13:30
And finally, on the audience insights side,
13:39
we are able to provide the results for our for a client to to analyse and then feed into their future strategies as well.
13:43
But in essence, how do we actually measure the the revenue that's generated from the audience engine?
13:54
Because it's all fine and dandy saying, Oh, we've created these audiences and seems to be doing well, but obviously measurement is a big, big thing.
14:01
The client needs to know when it needed to know exactly how much can be attributed to
14:09
specific audiences and even to specific media channels that were being activated on.
14:14
So they needed this level of insights and they needed a specific measurement tool to do so, which is the next case study called Marketo by.
14:19
Cool. So MRI, what what does MRI stand for?
14:31
So Moyes is marketing return on investment.
14:36
So obviously this can be a host of different things and can be quite difficult to understand and wrap it head around at first.
14:40
But if we think about the decision points firstly that a made in marketing,
14:47
we need to think of what timeframe and what key questions that we really tried to answer.
14:53
So, you know, if we start here on the left's strategic decisions need to be made yearly about
14:59
how much budgets Reckitt needed to put forward to activate campaigns in the UK,
15:04
for instance. And this kind of feeds all the way down to your budget update and planning as you
15:10
move through things quarterly and all the way into your individual campaigns.
15:16
So when we're looking at these decision points,
15:21
let's let's remember to focus on more why this specific use case is solely looking at campaigns performance.
15:23
So we're literally just trying to measure the performance of individual campaigns and measure measure everything related to it at a campaign level.
15:31
So what sort of questions really are we trying to to answer with them or why?
15:41
So how should I build a test and learn campaign to answer my brand hypotheses?
15:47
What is the genuine sales uplift of the campaign and what are the best performing channels within that campaign?
15:53
Of yet, these are the key questions to me really looks to answer.
16:00
And just a quick point. Our last case study will actually be looking at the brand strategy one as well.
16:05
So anything's. So MRI fundamentally solves three problems in improving campaign performance.
16:12
Firstly, in identifying single markets and why do we why do we need to identify similar markets?
16:20
Well, if we're testing a hypothesis, for instance,
16:27
for vanished carpet cleaners or dog lovers or cat lovers more likely to buy our products if we want to test this, we're going to need to.
16:31
Identical or not identical were pretty close to very similar markets in order to set up a fair experiment.
16:39
So, and more wide through the data science models that we've created is able to do this.
16:46
And also, when something the client asked for as well was to estimate required budgets in order to hit
16:51
specific campaign objectives and to indicate exactly to to hit specific campaign objectives.
16:58
And then these two kind of problems here and solutions that we provided happen pretty campaign swing the campaign sort of set up,
17:07
whereas the measurements of the incremental sales and the all white columns post-campaign normally around four to six weeks after so sorry,
17:17
the campaign lost around four to six weeks on the measurement period happened straight after to that,
17:25
not just for a bit of context as well what exists currently in markets. Normally, the price points for such a tool are actually quite expensive,
17:31
and the access to results happens maybe four to six weeks after the campaign has actually ended.
17:41
And with our tool, we with the more whites who were actually able to provide results within one week of the campaign ending.
17:48
So some of the big, big benefits of of AM always is accurate measurements, but also the immediate insights that it can give.
17:55
And because obviously in the world of business, things move very, very quickly and four to six weeks might be a long time to wait for a client.
18:04
So this has been a big value add that we're able to provide insights within one week.
18:10
And secondly, we've made sure that the market was scalable across different countries and different brands.
18:15
So, yeah, it is most definitely a scalable solution, and we've brought this to other clients as well.
18:21
Now, just kind of a high level slides details the models and a little bit more depth, but as I said,
18:29
you have access to this tech afterwards, which you can digest but will just quickly run through the models that we have as well.
18:36
So we have one model for identifying the single market schools, the mass markets model, which tests and control cells design.
18:44
And as mentioned, that's just setting up a fair experiment so it will spit out.
18:53
London and Manchester is two similar cities for you to set up your your tested controlled environment.
18:58
Then we have the budget threshold model, which does what it says on the label.
19:04
It estimates the required budgets to reach a measurable commercial objective and then for the measurements measurements will post-campaign models.
19:08
We actually have to. And this is this is where we've been able to provide the most insights to all kinds of records.
19:18
So firstly, we have the sales uplift model, which just measures through data science techniques, the real incremental uplift of the campaign.
19:26
And then we also have one called the decomposition model here, and the decomposition model is essentially able to break down this sales uplift.
19:36
So for instance, if we had a sales uplift of 10 percent or so,
19:46
the decomposition is able to say two percent of this came from your Facebook activation,
19:50
four percent came from your YouTube activation,
19:55
three percent came from a promotion and another one percent came from macro economic factors, for instance.
19:57
That was just a random example of off the top of my head, but we'll do a full on process where in just a moment.
20:04
So, yeah, an end to end use case at all.
20:14
Even so, the strategic question that we once got asked is can we increase Eric Botanica penetration?
20:17
So Erica, there's little there's plug in sprays that you get, which you can plug in at home.
20:26
They release a fresh fragrance. So the app, that's one of the one of our clients brands.
20:32
So can we increase Eric Botanica penetration amongst millennials by addressing relevant audiences with tailored messages and creatives?
20:38
So our clients basically did their own market research and through the audience engine as well,
20:47
they were able to come up with these target groups of home enthusiasts
20:52
environmentally conscious and the creatives and influencers all the product focussed.
20:56
So we obviously wanted to test each possibility between the creatives and the target groups.
21:01
So that means we needed for test sales.
21:07
And also won control, so as mentioned, to ensure that we're setting up a fair, fair experiment for measurements at the end.
21:11
So using the first model that the mass market trends model,
21:20
we were able to split up five similar regions that reacted similarly in terms of sales and media reaction,
21:24
essentially to to set up our test accordingly before running to the budget threshold model,
21:32
which gave a required budget in order to meet all our targets.
21:38
And given all this information, the clients where I could set up their campaign accordingly.
21:45
And then they executed the campaign. Sorry, done.
21:52
Can I just check what we mean by influencer here? Yes, yes.
21:56
So when we say improvements in the classic in the classic sense, so an influencer in terms of social media, for instance.
22:00
So it's like a person like that you would you put in an advert to for a particular product, for example?
22:07
Yeah, yeah. Or is it that you would get to tweet about your product or?
22:14
Yeah. So it's to do with, yeah, precisely that. So with the influencer individual actually tweeting about the product and then messaging
22:20
with regards to that is around their specific target audience that they have access to.
22:27
OK. Things. Yep.
22:35
So then we would run the campaign and come the end of the campaign, they want to measure the sales uplift in our way.
22:39
So this is a real, real output of the results that we provided and some of the insights that we provided.
22:47
So if we look at all the different folks this year, this was our control.
22:53
So we saw a five percent uplift over the time period.
22:56
And this is essentially what we're comparing against Great.
23:00
So we found that the influence of style and home enthusiast target rate was actually the best, the best campaign targets, essentially the best set up.
23:03
And we found a 15 percent sales uplift versus value sell.
23:15
And so this fit into our two to record strategy going forward to further increase our botanica penetration amongst the millennials group.
23:20
Cool. And yes, there's some of the key milestones then.
23:30
Yeah, we all now live in 18 different markets. We've done 75 different campaigns.
23:37
And yes, over four weeks to set up the markets completely from from collecting the data to actually being able to run more widely.
23:42
And this is a nice excerpt from the success that we brought to our client as a result.
23:52
So just onto the last case study then.
24:00
So as mentioned, if we look at what the decision points again, we spoke about more why looking at the campaign's performance specifically.
24:05
But now if we think about mix, we're looking at the brand strategy.
24:12
So some much more strategic decisions.
24:16
Instead of looking at, you know, the performance of a specific campaign, we're now looking at how a channel performs over two years,
24:18
for instance, and how that should feed into the next year or two year strategy.
24:26
So this is much, much more kind of important in terms of strategic level decisions, as this is obviously a big decision points for our client to make.
24:31
So how much should I invest in promotions, offline advertising, online advertising by brands and by marketing driver?
24:43
And what is the optimal channel mix in order to do so? So just maybe a little bit of insight into you guys into how this actually works,
24:48
so we shifted away from more of an economic econometric approach to to a more causal
24:58
approach thanks to the fantastic work that Sasha has pioneered here at Artefact.
25:03
And this has basically been able to attribute, you know, the real benefit of specific channels and campaigns.
25:08
There's a quick example, then, if we look at here on the left, we're able to say that, OK, so tbie was able to provide some benefits here.
25:15
But actually, if you really look at things with a cold lens and through all of fantastic causal models,
25:23
we're actually able to say yes, TV had a 35 percent increase versus the baseline.
25:28
However, if we actually take a deeper look,
25:34
five percent of this five percent total came through YouTube views in themselves like this to affect sales as a result.
25:38
So a little bit more about the causal model.
25:47
And if you guys have questions and Sasha is here to answer them at the end in 10 minutes or so, what's the main innovation that we're really,
25:49
really bringing to our clients in terms of Amex deliveries is the idea of causal graphs and essentially how each driver may influence another.
25:58
So essentially, we have to really start from some business assumptions because as we found out,
26:09
there are so many different possibilities and links between all the different drivers that to test this would require
26:14
huge amounts of computing power in the sense that it's not actually feasible and the results could be dubious as well.
26:19
So we actually had to start with the business assumptions and draw this graph out and validate
26:27
with the clients before actually testing the interdependencies between each of the drivers here.
26:33
So, yeah, quickly on to then the kind of use case here,
26:41
so I'll be had a lot of different criteria that we really need to to to to insure and fit with with regards to the Emirates product.
26:45
So we need to show that it was consistent with its previous mix provider so that they could compare
26:55
the results of ours versus the previous provider to ensure consistency and validity of their results.
27:03
It obviously also needed to be integrated into their ecosystem,
27:09
as well as providing more flexibility and granular brand loyalty in terms of results and something that is in the works and something that we're
27:14
building is to kind of enable this forward looking analysis of what we'd like to call scenario building and set the foundations to do so.
27:24
For that, we use saturation curves for that.
27:32
So, yeah, I guess the business brief, we had over one hundred and fifty questions to answer, which is obviously quite beefy,
27:38
but yet they range from all the different sales drivers from promotions to media marketing,
27:46
even the distribution channels and how this all affected sales themselves.
27:51
I'll just give this one a miss. We go. So in summary, with Max, it was a very big delivery for us.
27:59
And so the final death was was about 150 slides.
28:08
And we had a three hour session with our clients to walk through the results for our week UK with them.
28:12
So we were able to provide analysis of the brand.
28:18
And so every brand, but also we looked at specific segments as well as so, for instance, the different products that they had within week brands.
28:21
We looked at all the different channels of Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest,
28:30
Google search, just to name a few, as well as the individual campaigns as well.
28:35
Because some of them were seasonal campaigns, some of them may have been 10 seconds, you know, videos versus 20 seconds.
28:39
So our analysis included all of these different possible levers and insights, and we were also able to provide some analytics and as mentioned,
28:44
some foundations for a forward looking analysis using saturation perks, which we can touch on a little bit later.
28:54
But yes, that is those are the case studies.
29:03
So just a quick note bearing in mind this time as well a note on on the application process then as well.
29:08
So what are we looking for really at the moment, so I'm happy to announce through communications with Tom as well.
29:17
We reached about partnership with with Imperial.
29:23
So yes, we are officially a hiring partner, guys, and really looking forward to receiving a host of different applications as well.
29:28
So we chiefly looking for for three different roles at the moment. So we're looking for consultants, data scientists and data engineers.
29:36
So as mentioned, I'm a consultant. Sasha is a data scientist, but we are also looking for data engineers as well.
29:44
And it's really just to summarise this slide, which you will have access to when we're really looking for.
29:53
I guess, you know, the personal the personal traits are very important to us, you know, as traditionally we are a consulting firm,
29:59
we we want to ensure that all of our all of our employees have very strong interpersonal and communication skills.
30:06
So even as a data scientist or as a data engineer, you will have exposure to clients,
30:14
which we think is a big, big plus and definitely good for persons of relevance.
30:19
And it beats and it beats just focussing on the technicalities as well.
30:23
But we're also looking to constantly innovate as well. So we're looking for entrepreneurial mindsets,
30:31
and we do host regular sessions to brainstorm and push forward innovations in
30:36
the space as we most definitely a thought leader in data driven marketing.
30:41
And I think with all the technical sort of expertise, I think you're used to seeing this from all the data scientists.
30:46
They change their consulting applications.
30:53
I'm sure you guys have done previously, so won't go too far into that at the moment, but I'm sure you guys have a host of different questions.
30:55
So at this point, I want to open up to the floor and yeah,
31:04
we welcome any questions on anything to do with the case studies artefact or the application process itself.
31:10
Thank you very much. Yes, thanks so much, Dan.
31:18
Does anybody have a question you can either just raise your hand or you can type in the chat or you can just go ahead and ask your question?
31:22
I have a few just to kick off. So thank you very much, Dan, for the very interesting presentation.
31:36
And I can tell you that penetration of varnish amongst cat owners is quite high.
31:42
I just wanted to I wanted to ask you for a question like that sort of our cat and dog owners more likely to buy.
31:49
Vanished in what would presumably the answer to that is yes.
31:57
And then how would the how would the company go about targeting people with cats and dogs?
32:02
Or how would they find out who either has a cat or a dog or who is interested in that?
32:10
Would you go and look at their Facebook pages and see if they've got pictures of cats and dogs,
32:17
which you talk to Tesco and find out who's been buying cat food or what would you do?
32:22
Yes. Very good question. And I guess sort of coming back to maybe the audience engine first is through
32:30
the data that's available through first party second and third party sources.
32:38
We're actually able to to kind of spot the trends between different,
32:43
different customers that very much imply whether or not they could be cat owners or dog owners.
32:49
I think maybe the cat owners versus dog owners wasn't maybe the best example, because that can be a little bit more difficult.
32:54
But for things like environmentally conscious, it's actually very,
33:00
very clear to us based on they're based on the history of browsing that they are interested or environmentally conscious, so to speak.
33:03
So kind of touching back, as mentioned to the audience engine through the amalgamation of first party second parties.
33:13
