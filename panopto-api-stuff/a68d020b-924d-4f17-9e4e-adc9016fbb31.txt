Title: L04-L05 - Live Q&A
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova
Date: 22/10/2021
Now he's recording, so you will have access to that unit.
0:02
All right, I see there's more fans, but I don't see who specifically is raising them, so this doesn't really I'm sorry,
0:10
this doesn't really relate to the lectures except on the fall with the sheets, with names.
0:26
My name's not on it. All right. Let me check that.
0:31
So, um, let's deal with this when we started.
0:37
OK. Send me a message and I will put you up in the fall when everyone is settling into their room, so.
0:42
OK. OK, there we go.
0:56
So you should be able to see this thing now. So before we go back into the Q&A, let me explain a little bit to what we're going to do.
1:05
What we are doing right now is September one, joining the meeting on the turtle tunnel.
1:14
Then each of you has been assigned a group. So what we are going to do is that you're going to be working on small groups of 10 people,
1:21
each group, and you're going to be working together to solve the tutorial problems.
1:33
That's a real problem. You should have them available now in a.
1:40
On the trials section, you will see one on one.
1:44
Now, the group that you have been assigned, so it's next to the file that is with this.
1:50
You simply go to the file stuff in the general tunnel and look at the filename tutorial groups and look for your name in there.
1:58
So you should see a group number at the end next to your name.
2:11
So then join the group tunnel that you're hoping to sign according to a group number and work together.
2:16
And if you have any questions, you will see that there's a new channel called Tutorial Q on on teams where you should say, hey,
2:25
please come to group number five for group number twenty, whichever group you been assigned,
2:35
and then all of the lecturers that are going to be monitoring this to you.
2:40
And then we will join your group total and discuss the questions that you have.
2:45
And then after where we are all going to join back into the general channel just to
2:51
finish up the lecture and maybe discuss some questions that you all had in common.
2:55
Now, if any of the channels you you want to check are not visible and the last thing on skimps,
3:03
you will see at the bottom left or bottom left button or the Saskatoon tunnels
3:09
there you will see some additional tunnels if you're going to find one of them. OK, so I'm going to do this later.
3:19
But for now, let's go back to Q&A.
3:28
If you have additional questions, please, let's do about ten minutes more of Q&A and then we'll switch to the material.
3:31
So I think now we can so I can finally see.
3:46
Can you please state your question? And so I'm sorry.
3:51
Go first. Yeah.
4:01
So, um, on slide twenty five, you said that the extent of the circles on Conomos must be a part of two.
4:06
And I'm just wondering if that's the case. Must be a part of what I thought was two.
4:16
Yes. That's, that's, that's just how it works. That's the, the way it is defined, otherwise it's not doing what it's supposed to.
4:22
So what will happen if we have a circle and extend external three?
4:33
The result is incorrect. In fact, you can try it out and then try with a stable.
4:41
You will see that there are cases in which it's going to be incorrect. OK.
4:46
OK. I mean, in this case, it's just it's an arbitrary rule of the of this tool basically.
4:51
OK, so I see, I see the four more heads. So what I have at the top of the list, sorry if I'm not going in order in which you raised it.
5:01
I kind of know that I don't see so much more taped this.
5:10
So hands down. OK, so the next one is hold him.
5:18
So one of the slides, the map.
5:28
As for what is the map, the order of the columns is the same as the water rose.
5:32
And I was wondering if that's a necessary condition to ensure have the best circles.
5:40
Not so the only rule that you have to follow when you are there either rows or columns in a Carnamah,
5:46
is that only one of the variables can be changing as you move from column to
5:56
column so you can go from zero zero two zero one four four zero zero to one zero,
6:03
but you can just go from zero zero to one one as you move.
6:09
So it doesn't matter. It's the same rule if if the column goes like zero zero zero one and one zero zero have to be like the same ordering.
6:13
Not there's no relationship between condoms and gross.
6:24
It can be arbitrary sometimes if you fiddle with them around, it can help you find better resistance, but not necessarily.
6:30
And so this is an important thing to remember is that controls are a tool to find decent minimisation,
6:42
but they do not guarantee it's the simplest possible formula or description of a magic formula.
6:50
It's usually pretty good, but it's not guaranteed that it's going to be the best.
7:02
So that's why sometimes you fiddle with the ordering and you get better results.
7:07
Sometimes you don't. Sometimes it's the optimal, but sometimes it's not.
7:12
But it's usually a very good tool. And that's the one we are going to be using, basically.
7:16
OK, thank you, sir. So in some ways I've got a question in chat.
7:20
Could you please take a look? I'm in the library so I can tell very much. Yes.
7:28
OK. On that side on the meeting, I cannot see your question, so if you can taste it again, maybe.
7:34
His question is actually five twenty four.
7:51
Is there a specific reason why the green circle on the right only covers that single one rather than the whole column to minimise the time?
7:53
OK, let's clarify this 21 San Jose Folsom's four.
8:00
OK, let me share the screen so if you can. We got this one right?
8:07
Yes, and the question is, why is the green circle only covering the single one rather than the entire column?
8:19
Because it is just one example. Honestly, it's just an example to show you that that's a possibility.
8:29
It could be the entire column because that's the it that would be for.
8:35
And that's it. Thank you.
8:41
Like the story, by the way, both are correct.
8:47
Both will produce correct formulas that express this little stablest of this problem, just what is going to be smaller than the other.
8:53
But in cases like these, the table will be given to us like the majority will try to table or something,
9:05
even the table will be given to you or you will have something that will allow you to build it to a stable,
9:11
but you will build always a Carnamah from a table.
9:19
Who is going to construct the table? Well, that depends on the problem, right?
9:23
Sometimes you will be given hope to save a little for something.
9:27
We want to implement the Carnamah and later, as you will see in future lectures from that, then build a circuit.
9:31
Or it could be something entirely different, like, oh, here's my statement of what I want to be solved now.
9:38
Go and build a table for it and then minimise it up and then build a circuit, for example.
9:47
OK, so I'm say I'm going to go, OK, let's go back to the participant is OK.
9:59
So you hit head question. Apologies for asking questions, question from previous, but remember how we did like access to fifty six annotations?
10:16
Yes, one of those.
10:31
So for example, the NSA has access to fifty six, does to fifty to fifty six, the two to the bottom minus one equals to do this or is any six year.
10:33
Sorry, I'm not sure I follow what the question is, so what what they mean.
10:44
So we're supposed to like add the excess to the decimal number, right.
10:48
To convert it to binary just in excess 256.
10:53
Are we supposed to add to fifty six or is obviously still have to do the bot in minus one equals 256.
10:57
So we have to like that. And what exactly is the axis. The axis is the number on the excess X, it's the X so it's 256.
11:03
And basically if you look at the representation in one of those lines, it's like a cover so that you move around in like in an infinite loop,
11:11
you just move this many positions and positions and is equal to 256 and not due to the bottom and minus one equals.
11:19
The number of positions is 256. Yes, OK. So I'm sorry.
11:32
We should really start to talk. So I'm going to do one more question.
11:38
And I think that who was ready with questions raised before is Gabriel the rest?
11:41
Please, please feel free to use that so we can discuss things offline over there and both.
11:49
Although at the end of the lectures are we are monitoring that someone can answer questions over there.
11:54
OK, so Gabriel doesn't have a question anymore, so I just.
12:03
OK, so go ahead. Yeah. In all the examples in the lecture about them in terms of three variables, I was wondering,
12:06
is it mentioned specifically to have three variables and could it be more used to variables?
12:20
It could be. That depends on the problem. So a metre will have three variables in that term.
12:27
If the problem has three input variables is a problem, has to it's going to be two if it's 30 and it's going to be 30.
12:34
OK, sir, um, OK, if it's really quick, we can do it either way, I would prefer if we switch into the tutorial.
12:43
So is your question quick? Yeah, I asked him a question, I think I look so cool.
13:00
All right. So please take your name. There was someone who didn't have their name on on their list.
13:08
Send me a message. I think you can personally send me a message or just listen to the tutorial.
13:16
You drop your name there and I will I will send you a room.
13:23
So you can now disconnect here. Oh, by the way, before you start disconnecting, let's me back together.
13:32
So now it's half past eleven. And if I remember correctly, we have class until 12, 13.
13:40
We have one more hour. So let's meet back here in the general tunnel at 12, 15.
13:52
So we will have 10, 15 minutes to discuss any questions that I see are being repeated small groups and then we can discuss that together.
13:59
So good. Yes. All.
14:09
OK, so you know. When I leave the instructions for.
14:16
Now. But not everyone has turned yet.
14:40
I'm going to go and into some people to come back here.
1:02:22
I had a couple more dads, would it be OK if I took this off? I thought as well I want.
1:02:38
OK, all the way to 10, 14, for almost everyone has been told and yeah, let me just finish that and then we'll discuss this story.
1:04:01
All right.
1:04:35
Let's wait a couple more minutes. So 12, 20. Some people have not done yet.
1:04:56
OK, so there's not been many questions, which I guess it's good, I suppose it means that this tutorial was very simple.
1:06:22
It was meant to get up to speed or start getting up to speed.
1:06:36
And at the end of every tutorial, the answers will be available.
1:06:42
In this case, a schedule did so that you will have the answers in scientia at one p.m. So you have one more additional hour.
1:06:49
Nothing that really matters because remember, the drills are not marked.
1:06:59
This is just for you to practise exercises with other people's.
1:07:03
Another thing that there's relevant you can keep on working on your group, Tunnell's now after we wrap up.
1:07:12
Feel free to do that if you'd like to finish the tutorial on your own.
1:07:21
Just that you and me are not going to be there to help you.
1:07:27
But remember that you have a for that.
1:07:31
So we the few minutes that we have left is there may be some question related to with a tutorial that you would like to ask your.
1:07:34
Do we have to submit that answer then? OK, so I guess I just answer your question here is that no,
1:07:45
there's no there's no place for you to submit the answers because you just want you to practise.
1:07:52
Hopefully you should be able to hear me better. No. So is there any other question please can ask the question you decided to do that's OK.
1:08:11
Well, there's no other tutorial questions. Yes, I am saying.
1:08:23
So. OK, so what would you call when we were discussing that so for example,
1:08:37
is access to fifty six dangerous exacerbations due to this to the board and minus one.
1:08:45
Minus one, that's the positive upper bound and then and minus one negative.
1:08:51
That's about four for this range. We have something like access to 56 is to the bottom and minus one equals to 256 or is equal to 256.
1:08:57
Which one is? And is equal to 256, so then.
1:09:10
So you're telling me that in such a case, the range would be like from two to the bottom to fifty six minus one?
1:09:16
Is that not many? Many. That is the range. So sort of of the range of what the number we are accessing let's say.
1:09:25
Yeah. The range of excess and so forth. Like for example, for one that group largely just integers can be represented by excess by one too.
1:09:36
OK. I think that this is a question related to the coursework, but not.
1:09:44
Yeah, it's. Because the coursework has one off case that is there on purpose, that is about these 12 beats and X is five, 12 or 256.
1:09:50
I don't remember. I would like you to try to solve it on your own.
1:10:03
Remember that whether you get it right or not, this is a very small amount of points.
1:10:11
So it really doesn't make it's not going to make a lot of impact.
1:10:19
We can discuss it afterwards. I would like to I would like you to sit down.
1:10:23
And that's probably the most complicated question of the whole coursework of this coursework one.
1:10:28
And and what I'm trying to say here is that even if you don't get it right, we can discuss it afterwards.
1:10:35
And it's not going to have a big impact on your final mark,
1:10:42
because remember that these coursework is a portion of all the coursework marks and the whole of the whole coursework together take.
1:10:50
I don't remember if it was 15 or 20 percent of the whole module, Mark.
1:10:59
So you don't need to worry about about this in terms of what impact it could have on your marks.
1:11:05
I understand that you want to understand how to do it and.
1:11:12
You have two more weeks to solve that one. I think that's plenty of time.
1:11:18
I feel free to discuss it with other students. You can even use that.
1:11:22
I'm if you have questions about how to operate with this notation,
1:11:27
please don't just go asking directly the working in the system because you're supposed to do it on your own.
1:11:36
And yet we can discuss it after submission. OK, thank you.
1:11:44
Is there any other question?
1:11:51
I got a question, but I guess is kind of related to the previous one, but is it possible to represent number in excess for in a four big group?
1:11:58
Is the most significant bit for this group would be AIDS.
1:12:11
So what do you have to use excess weight to represent the numbers in the four bit group?
1:12:16
Not it is not possible to have an overflow, which I mean, things break down from the neat examples on the like.
1:12:24
The examples of those legs are the ones used in reality. Real use cases are that simple.
1:12:38
Once you go where those things are not symmetric and not, as you can see, fit all of it, that's partly where the coursework is taking things.
1:12:47
Give it your best shot and we will discuss it. OK, thank you.
1:13:00
Is there anything else? Just a quick question, because nonserious used about excess,
1:13:12
and so just to check excess and nienstedt for when all the bits are zero, that represents a negative end, right in the.
1:13:23
Yes, in the cases that we had in class.
1:13:36
That's true. OK, are there cases where that's not true, these cases where things are not aligned,
1:13:42
where the number of things that you have in your number and the excess are not there are half negative and half positives in those cases.
1:13:51
That's not true anymore, because basically, if you just apply the formula right from this light, which if you want, I can write a note again,
1:14:04
unless I'm pointing to the exact places,
1:14:15
one of the methods to solve all the excess and problems and that should basically you just go ahead with that.
1:14:19
And that's the answer to any problem, because if we start solving specific cases,
1:14:30
that's probably a less useful than if we just looked at the whole of it.
1:14:38
So I'm not sure where exactly is in this. And we have two minutes left.
1:14:43
I will again, I don't know. I hope that the note that I got it for overflows clarify the problem.
1:14:49
So I'm going to do something like that for four days and see if that's four or five for everyone.
1:14:59
And that probably means that I should try to find the slides so that everyone can get
1:15:06
to a solution with the information that is explained and no additional clarifications.
1:15:13
Well, it's always me. That's right. I mean, that's that's why we are here and we have an open questions.
1:15:21
Sorry, there's some neighbours that just. Well, it just doesn't right now.
1:15:27
I guess there's an excellent queue to finish this because it's going to be hard to hear me.
1:15:34
So unless you have something really, really quick about the organisation, then we can go and meet again next week.
1:15:39
We publish the lectures and slides for next week and the beginning of the week to look at it and we will have another tutorial again.
1:15:53
So that's basically. Thanks very much to our.
1:16:05
Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. OK, let's see if I can stop the recording, though.
1:16:14
It seems that we recorded like an hour and a half or an hour of silence also.
1:16:22
