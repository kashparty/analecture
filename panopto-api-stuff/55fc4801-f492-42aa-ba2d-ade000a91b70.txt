That's not even at this point. Yes.
0:04
All right, let's try this again, so we are obviously you've got people in one,
1:12
four, five and three 11 and also some people who are joining us, correct?
1:16
Really. So we're going to try to keep attention to all these different settings,
1:20
but at least for the people that are here, obviously, if you have any questions, do raise your hands.
1:25
I can see you in three, 11 and one four five.
1:29
They are there to help you out there who will keep an eye out of the audience.
1:33
My friends will be with them. So if you do want to ask the question, just make them aware.
1:39
Also be asking and people who are attending remotely.
1:44
I would just suggest that if you do have a question, then please do unmute yourselves and hand speakers.
1:48
I hope I won't be able to follow up the chat, although some people will try to help with the chat,
1:55
but I would just suggest easiest ways to unmute and ask questions. OK, good.
1:59
So we're going to do one hour lecture and then we've got British royals assuming
2:04
people just stay in the rooms if you are going to hang around for that too.
2:09
Just quickly go over what we did on Tuesday. We talked about we introduced business logic, which is what I'll be teaching in the weeks to come.
2:14
We really focussed mostly. We focussed essentially on what is law in general, but we really focussed on the syntax.
2:23
So we looked at what the logic is built from, which we said is the popular charlatans, the connectives.
2:31
And we've got extra punctuations which are just there to help us read the expressions.
2:38
And we looked up.
2:43
The main aspect that we kind of ended with last time was looking at bindings because although we might add brackets and that might help us,
2:44
but also there's certain conventions about how to read these expressions, and we looked at generally the order from strongest to weakest.
2:53
And that helps us to Bowling's, let's say, the arguments of the connectives and understand the meaning behind the expressions that we write and logic.
3:00
OK. The main message that I left you guys with last time is that sometimes it can be very ambiguous where you might write something,
3:08
but it's not what you want to say in English or it's the other way around.
3:17
So you always make sure that you add the brackets if you are in doubt or you know what you're trying to say might be in doubt.
3:21
OK, we'll move on to, I think the last bit that we looked at, we're about to start with is this notion of formation tree.
3:29
So what we had done is we use the brackets to help us understand what what we're trying to list,
3:38
what the formula is trying to express, although we've not yet gone down to meeting to meeting.
3:45
But another way to to understand is, well, to read the formula could be through this what we call the formation tree.
3:51
I just want to say there were a couple of others.
3:57
The formation tree and the way that we can look at this formation tree is the main
4:02
thing to try to understand is how we can construct these in such a way that actually,
4:07
if you collapse this tree, it sort of gives you what you would have read with the brackets.
4:12
So it's just another way to visualise or to express the formula.
4:16
So if I let me just try this and try to switch to the cameras in the other rooms can see.
4:20
So but then we is this guy doing, then just remember, OK, let me just write this down, first of all, and then I'll switch the camera.
4:25
So, so the tree, the formula that we're trying to express to this tree will look at how we can construct these things is we look from bottom.
4:35
We go back up. So the idea and we'll look at how we can construct.
4:42
So if I write this, I'll switch to the cameras for the others, but I'm just going to write this person and we'll explain how these are constructed.
4:45
OK. Hopefully, this is clear for everybody who's joining from the other rooms.
5:06
So I suppose this is the formula that I have and now I want to.
5:20
We're just going to reverse what we've just done now. That is, how can I?
5:23
How can I construct understand what I'm trying to express here through this notion of information by putting together a building this formation tree?
5:27
The idea, essentially, is to look at what we call and we'll go into the notation a bit is a principle.
5:35
So what is it? What is it that let's say the meet the what is the weakest, let's say, binding that you might have in this formula?
5:41
In this case, really, we're going to understand this formula, something which essentially is an application.
5:49
OK, on one side, we know that these applications take two types of arguments, so they take two arguments.
5:55
So there's going to be an argument which we called like the antecedent, and there's an argument which we call the consequence.
6:01
Essentially, we focus our attention purely to the antecedent of the formula that we have on this side.
6:06
What? We've got two connectors, so you want to think about, I mean, the way that I look at as well, which is the one is the weaker one,
6:12
which in this case, I would say, given what we've looked at in terms of strength and precedence would be the.
6:19
OK. So we know that the also takes two arguments in this case.
6:24
So on this side, we've got the knotty and the other side, we've got the Q.
6:28
The Q is just a problem for lots of. So you can just have the key right here at the bottom.
6:32
On the left hand side, we have a not p where there's a connector, which takes a single argument.
6:36
So what we have is the note, essentially, and we know that the not only takes the single argument, so we've got the P.
6:42
So what we've ended up at the leaf that you want to think about.
6:47
This is an upside down tree where this is the root and this is the leaf and what we end up with the leaf, all these proposition letters.
6:50
So this is what we've done on the left hand side.
6:58
So now if you look at the right hand side, we've got you can imagine that what we've got here at the back is just to be some formula.
7:00
Find out what the contents of here, which is again, we would take it from the week.
7:07
It will be the implies and we know that the implies takes two arguments the left hand side.
7:11
We've got just the opposite p,
7:16
but the right hand side we have this small medium and this formula only has the theory when we have what we've expressed here, the formula.
7:18
So we have the connective ads, which we know takes two arguments. And what we've got is here the Q and the.
7:26
So what you've got here is essentially you can think about it as if it's the weakest binding.
7:33
One was the bottom you have. It kind of get grows in strength as you go down.
7:37
And what you need to end up with is essentially the prepositional atom's right at the end you'll never end up with at the end and not pink,
7:41
it has to beat the proposition laptops. And that's how you know, this is one way of knowing whether what you've written is the correct formula.
7:50
OK, because if it ends up like this, then it's not a correct formula. So this is one way you can use it.
7:58
And once you've done this, then you could. Just as I said, you can squash it essentially.
8:03
And what you have is the formula that but as you've noticed, I've not put any of the brackets down here.
8:07
So really what this has, you'll always have at the root, either a connector or a prepositional atom.
8:11
If your formula is essentially just p, it's obviously happy, then that's just the root.
8:18
And what you have here is the scrunching nodes are always going to be connected and that leaves to always have the propositional atoms.
8:23
And that's one way you can tell that the formula that you've constructed is correct, but also,
8:31
it just shows, is one way of also reflecting the precedence that you have through the packaging convention.
8:36
Any questions on that here or elsewhere? But.
8:45
OK. So.
8:51
In building this story, some there's some terminology that we use is that the the connective that we
8:58
have right at the right at the root is what we call a principle connected.
9:04
We might call it the main connected in our case, in the example we have just thrown, we're just a minute ago was the implication of this case.
9:09
That was our main connector. So what it tells us effectively was you have the main connective, then you know that the formula is the type.
9:17
Something implies something as a basis of what we call the overall logical form.
9:26
OK, so we know it's an implication formula regardless of what you have or how complicated these parts are.
9:31
So we call that the main cause, the overall logical form. Now what you also bear in mind is that you look at various examples.
9:37
So we have, you know, P and Q implies, are so the mean or the main connective there.
9:48
The principle connected is going to be the implication of that case.
9:55
So we know that in that instance, the overall logical form is something implies like in this case probably implies.
9:59
So the case of the second example, we have not in between brackets, p implies not Q.
10:06
In that case, the principle collective we have here is going to be the not because, as I said, well, you've got already in brackets enclosed.
10:13
So the general would say the overall logical form of the formula,
10:21
not because obviously what we have there in the root, we're going to have the connective not OK.
10:25
Now in the case of the you know, you have repeated conjunctions is a again,
10:32
depending on the binding convention that we might use in our case, we did say that we would be left of.
10:36
So therefore you will have an end at the roots, but likely going to be the second one because that's the weaker ones.
10:42
And people think about it because we we said the binding conventions, it was going to be starting from the left most.
10:48
So it is again of the the overall logical form being.
10:54
And I just I want to bear in mind that when I've spoken here,
10:58
I've stressed the term overall logical form because obviously a formula can have several logical forms,
11:03
but we're focussing on the above is the overall logical form. So if I give as an example here, not p implies, not q.
11:09
I mean, you can imagine I could potentially replace the Note Q with with psi or I could I could replace the whole formula p.
11:16
Not a p implies not q with a C.
11:24
All right. So there's several logical forms, but what we talked about before was when I talk about the main.
11:28
So when I talk about the overall logical form, it is focussing on the main connected.
11:34
Any questions? OK.
11:39
So an important turn. That we often will come across and you will come across is this notion of some formula.
11:44
So what are the some formulas for a given formula that we might express?
11:54
And these are essentially, as you say, these are the constructs in a way that you put that appear that say within within your formula.
11:59
But it's important to bear in mind that not everything that you might be building from these parts is what we consider a simple formula.
12:08
So let's look at the example this is the same example that we had previously looked at.
12:16
And essentially what the sub formulas are or every formula that you can construct,
12:21
essentially by considering the various connectives avenue for the formation.
12:26
So for example, I have this sub formula p from the tree that we looked up for from this leaf.
12:32
We have the proposition. And so that is a sub formula.
12:38
I can then have another sub formula, which is just going above it by considering the negate the negations and not here by saying not OK.
12:41
Now, similarly, if I take the not p on one side as a simple formula,
12:49
then by considering the connected or then I can have not p or Q as another sub formula.
12:54
OK, so really, we're looking at it from bottom up as a way of consequence of formula.
13:01
If I look now at the FA, somebody is looking at the slides on the far right.
13:05
Then we also have here's a simple formula. Q and on the far right, but also on that's that's a once a formula, I can construct another set formula.
13:10
I think P implies Q. And so these are all things that we would use the formation for us to write in all the possible sub formulas.
13:19
Then these are the ways that you can build these formulas. What's important to bear in mind, for example, here, is that I have two sub formulas.
13:29
And I'm sorry, I think you muted your muted. Oh.
13:50
OK, yeah. How about the better? Oh, well, I was amused for that long.
14:08
Yeah, it wasn't long. OK, if you ask. I not everybody's patience with trying to get this to work.
14:16
OK. So as I said, so there are certain sub formulas that we consider that are that appear within this formation.
14:25
But there are others that, you know, you might think because of the connectors they appear or the Professor Larson, because there are some formulas.
14:32
So for example, if you look at on the second, let's say, the second the not the root, but the level beneath on the right we have P implies Q and R.
14:38
We would never say P plus q on its own as a sub formula.
14:49
OK. So it has to be P implies Q and as a supplement.
14:52
So you don't just think parts of what's written there and consider them as a supplement equally on the sides here where if you have not poor Q,
14:57
he or she was not a sub formula is not P or Q right?
15:06
Just a quick comment on notations stop.
15:13
Sometimes when we are trying to be, you know, going through this method, representational,
15:16
I just want to talk about arbitrary formulas of arbitrary sub formulas and or provisional atoms.
15:21
You might commonly come across notations like this in books or in papers or so forth, which is essentially just saying like at the top,
15:27
I might have a big edge and and just say we did that from assuming that is then and and formulas that I'm just joining together.
15:33
Similarly, when it comes to this junction, you might have various ways in which we express this notation, but they all mean the same thing.
15:43
They're just kind of funny symbols to simplify.
15:50
What we're trying to express is the same thing as using nuts, essentially when we have the signal for other forms of operations.
15:52
OK, so don't be alarmed. It's essentially, I mean, I might use instead of a I might use, as I said,
15:58
a proposition Latin or I might be using a misrepresentation like fire or so.
16:06
OK. All right. So let's quickly go over some terminology that I often use and you will come across, undoubtedly.
16:11
So if we have a formula of the form either as we said before or falsity or truth or people probably still assume,
16:19
then we call these atomic formulae either just a proposition atom you can construct
16:27
or a formula constructed from a prepositional atom or the falsity or truth.
16:32
So if I have a formula which is preceded by not, I'll just call it the negated formula.
16:38
Obviously, if the wording itself is that propositional atom or its falsity or truth,
16:45
then I just call it a negated atomic formula when we have formulas with conjunctions.
16:50
And so what I will refer to on what appears on the right and the left hand side of of the conjunction,
16:57
just I can I conjunct and the formula being a conjunction similarly with a disjunction,
17:02
the formula if it contains if I'm talking about a formula with the overall logical form light or psi,
17:07
then I'll just call a junction and I'll call each of those arguments as a distinct.
17:15
When we talk about probably excuse me, I already use the term antecedent in consequence of the previous slide.
17:22
But really, what I mean by antecedent is anything that appears before on the left hand side of the arrow,
17:29
and the consequent is what appears on the right hand side of the arrow in case of the formulas that have the if and only if,
17:35
then we call them bi directional implication. OK, so that's just generally the terminology that you will come across very often.
17:43
And what we when we're talking about all papers. Another important term that will come across we're using very often is this notion of
17:51
a literal and in literal is essentially either an atomic or negated atomic formula.
18:03
So in the case that we have P, R or not falsity or took, these are all the rules and clauses are essentially a disjunction of one or more natural.
18:09
So in this case, formulas of the if we look out the examples here, we could consider even a formula which has just a single propositional atom.
18:23
In this case, a distinct or also a formula that just from a negated, literal negated atomic formula, is also a distinction.
18:33
But also, we could have any of these forms as well as long as we they are described as a disjunction of literal then.
18:42
And these are called clauses and these are very important.
18:50
And you come across these quite a lot when it comes to symbolic and automated types of reasoning.
18:53
Because in a sense, if you can build the formulas in these forms or these forms or other types of forms,
18:59
they're much easier to compute, whether they are true or not true.
19:06
So these types of constructions are really important as logic, and you'll come across reasons for this and how they impact computation.
19:09
And so just a quick, probably kind of quick question here.
19:17
So you have a formula p or not Q and not p by.
19:21
But suppose a raise of hands here is only to be in the other ones as well.
19:27
How many people would say that that is in fact a close? Yes.
19:33
Well, if not one. Anybody can.
19:38
Many of the rooms as well or remotely can also. And he.
19:43
Yeah.
19:54
Oh, well, we only have these drones, but we also have some things because because the fact that we have a conjunction appearing within the formula,
19:56
therefore it is not considered to be a close correct. Again, about notices.
20:07
Sometimes people just allow the empty clause to be considered at this juncture. I mean, the officer this is actually is a clause.
20:13
Yes, it is. But also some people might just treat the empty clause as also accept that the just treat it as falsity.
20:20
All right, so that is as far as syntax goes and hopefully all the places that we've used and how to construct these formulas are clear by now.
20:30
But now we want to understand what they mean. OK? We have some intuition because we're using things that we commonly use in English and implies.
20:41
But there's a semantic meaning that there's a way to determine whether the expression that we write is actually true or false.
20:48
And we're going to look through.
20:55
We're going to look at exactly how we can understand or determine whether the claims are in fact true or false from the semantics that will come in.
20:56
OK. So the importance is that as those probably already should, I can.
21:06
I can have as many symbols and I can write as many formulas. And we really need a methodical way to build their meanings, essentially.
21:11
And this is where the semantics for proposition logic comes from.
21:19
So what we want to do is we want to be able to determine and study, for example,
21:23
arguments or whether I give you, you know, if I give you premises by, say, if these premises are true.
21:28
Can I infer a certain conclusion? I want to be able to make good inference,
21:34
good arguments by in a way determining the truth and falsity of the proposition
21:39
of atoms that we have and the logical forms of these pooling connected.
21:45
So to wait.
21:49
I want to be able to just use those expressions and those connectors to determine with an argument that I've expressed is in fact the valid argument.
21:50
To look at a serious do that we need to understand the art you are saying in
21:58
the first place and how we can determine truth and falsity of expressions.
22:04
So often we'll talk about it is I might make a claim and a claim might be in a certain situation true and it might be in another situation.
22:08
False.
22:18
So one claim could be that I am teaching logic on Thursday, the 18th of November, and in a situation where I am in fact teaching it, it is true.
22:19
But in a situation where I'm not right here, I'm not in this room and it's not 18.
22:29
It is not true. So the truth and falsity and that sense could be determined through or can change based on these situations.
22:33
And so we also understand how can we understand the truth and falsity by looking at the most basic element that we have in a form.
22:43
So the notation that often uses a set of a right double T for true the truth value truth and I'll write double f for the truth value false.
22:52
Sometimes the write zero for false and one for for truth.
23:02
But in whatever convention that we use in this case, I said I'll double team and double check.
23:07
The first thing we want to be able to say is we want to be able to determine the true value of a proposition atom.
23:11
And so for that, what we assume or what we consider is what we call an atomic evaluation function and what
23:17
that evaluation function is essentially just assigns a a truth value to a proposition.
23:23
So that starts at the most basic level. And obviously there could be many other situations.
23:31
And therefore, in each of the situation, the assignments might very so.
23:36
I might be in a situation, for instance, where I will consider an atomic evaluation function, be in it.
23:40
I want to consider a situation in which P is true so that I would express that for
23:46
me by saying I'm considering such a situation which the BP equals double team.
23:52
OK, so that's a formal way of expressing that a proposition atom is true in any situation.
23:58
Now I use an efficient efficiency here and find other people might use different notation.
24:05
I could be talking about evaluation, function. Age doesn't matter.
24:09
OK, so in a sense, this is not what it actually does. This assignment of this?
24:13
Well, this is what construed values.
24:17
Now, once I've built what I've defined as evaluation function, which can assign the proposition atoms I can build now,
24:20
meaning to more complex formulas that are built are constructed from the propositional atoms.
24:28
For that, what we do is we have what a general evaluation function.
24:36
So in the sense you want to think about this evaluation function, that it just extends the atomic evaluation function that we've seen.
24:40
So if the definition says if we have a set of propositional atoms and we have the as the atomic evaluation function for those set of atoms,
24:47
then the evaluation function surgical formula assigns truth values to the formula, according to these rules in particular.
24:57
So we define the truth value of a formula constructed from a proposition atom by thought through its its value.
25:07
The Atomic Evaluation Function formula, which says P, is true if the evaluation function assigns truth to the propositional atom.
25:19
And then simply what we have is the truth value of a conjunction is then determined essentially by the truth value of in con.
25:31
So I would say that a formula of the overall logical form by and so it is true if and only if values are true and also is true.
25:41
OK, if you look at the disjunction that I say follow the formula five or so is true if and only if one of the decisions is true.
25:53
One of them has to be true for that formula as a whole to be true.
26:03
Now, the implication will be revisiting, by implication, quite a few times actually to debate how close it is, essentially to what we say in English.
26:07
But the idea is that the formula of the type PHI implies upside is true in many cases, either.
26:17
If Italy if the antecedent is false. So at the end, see this whole thing.
26:27
For me, it is true or the consequences must be true.
26:32
So if I say if I express something like if I, if I eat a cake, then I'm full, it means that that formula or that claim is true.
26:36
If I eat a cake and if I don't need a cake, then that formula is true or if I am full in the formulas.
26:47
So that's what we mean by what what meaning is given to formulas of that time.
26:54
And then we have the if and only if so the bi directional implication formula,
26:59
which is true if and only if we want to bear in mind that the true value of the formula on the left or the right of the SEC is now identical.
27:03
So both of them are true of both of them are false, then that formula evaluates to true.
27:13
OK. Then we will have the false the the the the formula, the atomic formula falsity and truth.
27:18
In this case, you want to just remember that in that case that obviously it is always going to be
27:26
false is in every situation and truth is always going to be assigned the truth value.
27:29
OK, so that's that's what we tried. This is what the formula for this evaluation function studies basically tells us how we can build meeting
27:36
a very complex formula by through interpretation or understanding the meaning of the parts of it.
27:46
Any questions? I've been on the yep.
27:54
What's the difference between the location with the other?
27:59
Okay. Yeah. Very good question.
28:05
The very question and I stress do not confuse them in the way that when we talk about falsity and truth as these symbols, these are formally OK.
28:08
So these are formulae that we write. Whereas the double T of the double f are truth values that we assign to.
28:19
OK, so that's that's the main difference that we need to bear in mind.
28:27
Also, when we look at so never, never write.
28:32
I never look out, for example, never write.
28:37
You know, instead of the way, whenever you see here or double up for double team, never write the truth of falsity symbols which are performative.
28:40
All right, so let's look at a few examples.
28:52
So suppose that I've now I'm considering a situation in which the atomic evaluation function for the propositional atom p is true.
28:55
The atomic evaluation function assigns to the propositional atom.
29:05
False. OK, so what would we assign then?
29:11
In that case, what would the evaluation function for? Not P Q?
29:15
What would be the result for that? What truth value would be assigned to not paying in this case?
29:20
Yeah, because because you true, therefore not peace is false.
29:29
How about the second you not Q the truth?
29:34
OK? How about P and Q? Cause that was why.
29:38
Sorry. Because. OK. How about P or Q the.
29:45
Yeah, it's not P and not Q. So and then P implies not Q.
29:50
So because not Q is in this case going to be true?
29:58
How about that? We consider a different situation where we assign P the truth value polls and we
30:04
assign Q the truth value to what would we get in this case for the first formula?
30:09
Not if it was not Q. Q.
30:13
Q, not even. Not Q. And that P implies not Q two, because we have in that case, we are p being false.
30:20
So what's important to bear in mind is that so when I tell you, is the formula true or false,
30:39
then it doesn't make sense to ask that question without giving you a situation.
30:45
So. So it's just like if I say Q three x is three x equals seven.
30:49
True, let's we're talking about a particular value for X then doesn't really make sense.
30:54
Great. So let's look at how we can understand generally these evaluation functions and and what they mean.
31:01
So what we what we gain from the definition that I've just covered with you is this notion of what we say is functional.
31:07
So these collectives are the connectors that we're focussing on, at least here in propositional logic.
31:16
We say they're true functional because essentially the truth value of the formula can be determined by the true size of the connected sub formula.
31:21
So in a sense, I could be replacing the truth. I could be replacing what's p with s.
31:33
However, if if he is true, in essence, true, essentially the way we value it in conjunction is preserved.
31:41
So that's what we say. They're true functional, so they're determined by the truth values of the Connexions, the formulas.
31:48
And I just put a double quotation on connected because I'm just mean about the two three.
31:53
And if I'm talking about a conjunction, I'm talking about the arguments that the one immediate,
31:57
the immediate support means that are connected by the conjunction.
32:01
That's an important concept to bear in mind, and we'll go through examples of things that are not true functional.
32:06
I mean, it's probably worth actually mentioning here. So if I.
32:11
So for argument's sake, I might want to talk about, I want to talk about define some connective for for logic, which is, let's say.
32:17
It's. It's possibly the case, though, that's going to be a collective that I'm on to use,
32:30
and I want to see whether if I use that, whether that is true is functional in this case.
32:37
So I might the way that I might consider whether it is possibly the case as a truce on the or not is by considering,
32:44
let me consider two to proposition Latham's. Let me define them. So one is I am.
32:56
I am teaching as one as one composition Latin represented by P and I might consider another one, which is, let's say, two plus two is five.
33:03
OK. These are two claims that I want to represent. So it might be the case if I if I consider it a disconnect, it is possibly the case.
33:15
And now I perceive that by the fact that I'm saying I'm teaching, you might say, well,
33:23
the statement that says it is possibly the case that I'm teaching is true, even if it's even if it's actually the real case.
33:29
I'm not teaching, so I might say I'm not teaching. But the the statement, it is possibly the case that I'm teaching could be true.
33:37
Whereas the statement, which says it is possibly the case that two plus two is five is false.
33:46
So what we have is this one connector that is depending on what was I shall assume you
33:53
have what both of them have the same values and both would be false suddenly becomes,
33:59
as a statement, true and false. So we say in that case, the the collective it is possibly the case is not true.
34:04
It's functional. Both examples about the that's just an important idea, at least the ones that we are expressing in writing in our professional logic.
34:12
Arch is functional, so you can determine whether the form is true or false,
34:19
using them purely by considering the truth and falsity of the same formulas,
34:23
regardless of and in fact with values rather than than than, yeah, rather than other forms.
34:28
Just a quick note about disjunction. So in our case, when we write them in composition logic, we really need an inclusive or as opposed to exclusive.
34:35
So if you want to have exclusive more than we have to add a con. So you might say that by website and not space, but it is in terms of interpretation.
34:43
It is true if either of them are true or both of them.
34:54
So if an incident on set up when to get the form, the expression, if there's smoke, there's fire.
35:04
And if it's false, there's smoke. Does that make sense? Does that make the whole claim true?
35:11
Well, obviously in in some terms of English, this is what I'm saying in terms of what we might say in English and how the semantics of implication
35:21
are different because in implication in the sense that we write them in a Boolean logic,
35:28
the whole formula is true when in this case there is smoke, when there isn't smoke.
35:34
So if there is a smoke and the whole formula is true, however,
35:41
obviously in English we say there is no smoke then doesn't seem to be true as a formula that there is that there's there's smoke,
35:44
there's fire as how to express what we're trying to say.
35:52
So this isn't the distinction to bear in mind, and we'll go into techniques to translate English to logic.
35:55
These are things to record subtle differences.
36:00
And what we're trying to do, the logic we're trying to be very precise in English or is the language really does contain ambiguity,
36:03
let's say, or when we mean and OK. But there's a very precise meaning that we have in the way that we write things and composition logic.
36:10
OK. All right, so that was one way in which we can determine what we wish we we can express.
36:17
This amount is that it connected us through this notion of truth tables and all these truth tables, as we've seen, at least, for example,
36:28
so far is that we have, we assume, a situation to say, let's assume in that situation where the the eternal truth is that proposition is true.
36:36
And and then we won't consider another situation where the atomic valuation function is false.
36:43
We can actually express all that information in what in a truth table,
36:48
what the truth table just considers is all the different possible situations and gives the truth values to all the different atoms.
36:53
And then from there, you can build the truth value for a whole complex formula.
37:02
Based on that, you can. I'm going to try to switch to this and think about the notes.
37:06
OK, we'll work with the board for a bit of a slide.
37:17
So if we can set the table on the left, which is I'm considering on the full column, on the left column the proposition that S&P.
37:21
So when we when we write this truth, tables, if you've not come across them before is on the far left.
37:30
You essentially just write you list of the top,
37:36
all the provincial items that you have in the language that you are interested in or want to be able to represent.
37:40
And you essentially list at the bottom all the different truth values that they can take.
37:46
And then from there you start building on the right hand side the more complex forms of the form of the formula
37:51
that you're trying to do as they start evaluating the formulas until right at the far right of that table.
37:59
You'll have the formula that your your you're trying eventually to evaluate, essentially.
38:04
So if you look at the table with P and not P, so p as a probability, Latham can only take one of two values.
38:09
So I've listened to you both. And then from there, I know that if it's true, that not only will be false and if it is false, then obviously not true.
38:15
And here I'm just. Similarly, if you can imagine where five signed the second table, the right or more complex formula where mentioned,
38:25
you've reached the two values of these that you'll notice that actually,
38:33
what we get here through this truth table is essentially representation of that evaluation function that we just saw of.
38:36
See if you've got one thing to Vermont, I suppose, yes.
38:46
Suppose you've got two propositions items P and Q.
38:50
How many rows do you think you'd have just for evaluating those?
38:55
Well, different comedy, different combinations, can you help with that proposition?
39:02
Sorry. Somebody is trying to. What are we?
39:11
Well, yes, because obviously you can have, you know, things that aren't true both and both true and false or being falsely the other one true.
39:14
So you could determine the number of rows by considering the number of apples.
39:22
All right. Just to give an example, the correspondence between what we've seen as a prop in the evaluation function, the truth table.
39:29
So take the formula, which is P implies q. Well, I'm considering the p value is true and Q value is post.
39:37
This essentially corresponds to what we saw in the truth table where we had here p being sorry, five being P and C being Q in this case.
39:44
And according to the truth table evaluates to false. Essentially, if we look at our definition of evaluation function,
39:56
we know that P implies cuz true if and only if P is evaluated to true or QS evaluate it's true.
40:03
But in our case, what we know essentially here is that P is evaluated to churn from what we've said right at the top, which is obviously false.
40:12
Similarly, we know also that Q was false, which according to for the formula to evaluate to true, it should have been true.
40:22
So therefore, obviously, since the right hand side is a source that obviously we know that P plus Q is false,
40:31
which corresponds to what we have in the table.
40:38
So that's just a way of showing how these two actually reflect the same information, something that I do want to mention quickly.
40:40
If you go back to the formation theory that we looked up,
40:48
you can also determine the truth value by revisiting information theory and just assigning truth values to those prepositional atoms at the bottom.
40:52
And then just work your way up. So in the case where we've seen, I might say belief previously, p was true and then Q was false.
41:02
And then from there, I know if P is true, then not P is false, etc. So this is another way where you can.
41:10
Yeah, I chose those so as the right hand side.
41:15
Yep, that's right. So I think, you know, sometimes you write things and don't notice that people might not come across the same of aviation, right?
41:22
Fantastic. So one thing you might just worth bearing in mind is that and often there are questions about this,
41:34
and if you go look through previous exams and you might see questions that that kind of are around this topic.
41:44
The notion is that any truth table that you build.
41:51
So if you have if you want to define like a binary connective and you just plug in, let's say in this case, I'll have the spider connectable.
41:57
This is a particular one which is very common,
42:05
but I could have essentially put any connective there between I applied to find so and I could just plugged in an evaluation.
42:08
So I might have said, you know,
42:16
if you have by being true and so being true that then the formula using this new connected that talks about is is also true,
42:18
and I might give different valuations depending on the combinations of the two applying.
42:26
So the idea is that any truth table that you build, let's say for this case, a binary connective does itself kind of determine a connector.
42:32
Essentially, in this case,
42:41
what we have is this one and it has a special property and that any other connector can be defined in terms of ask the question at the back.
42:43
Is this basically ignored? Sorry, U.S.D.A.
42:52
Yeah, I mean, effectively said, you know, you could all express through that would be one of those connectors they can build.
42:56
Absolutely. So you can build many of those connectors using them.
43:03
So essentially, it's it's only it's only false if both of them are true, but because one of them is false and therefore the formula is true.
43:07
So you can use it just to demonstrate you can use that to express other formulas.
43:18
As I said, in other connective, so it's not say that I want to express using the shape of stroke one.
43:24
The formula, not patent. And any ideas on how you might express that.
43:31
Yes, he stroked stroke. Yeah, exactly why this is true, then true stroke, true evaluates to false.
43:37
Yes, vice versa. Exactly. So in a sense. Exactly. I don't know.
43:47
Let me a quick question actually to the other rooms. Can you hear the audience when they speak the side?
43:51
Yes. Fantastic. I wondered whether I should repeat it or not. OK, great.
44:00
So one suggestion is that actually you can right? Not Pee Express by saying pee pee.
44:04
Any other deal is another way of expressing it. The question is what is that hippie stroke truth?
44:11
So that's another way. Is there a question? I'll just quickly switch to camera just to show that, in fact, another way.
44:20
So there were two two ways in which we could express. So we said P, not p.
44:36
So obviously p could be the true or to be false.
44:42
And we know they're not p would be in this case, false in this case will be true.
44:47
And the question was what can we write on both sides of the shipper stroke here to be able to express
44:51
not p and that is that we can actually do that by expressing key stroke and pain because in a sense,
44:58
this statement is true if one of the slides is false in this case, because p p stroke p both in the truth,
45:05
in this case we know is false, but in case false stroke, false leads, one of them is false in this case.
45:17
So that would be true. And if you look at the truth table, they have exactly the same truth value, and that's how we can tell.
45:22
I can write this in terms of this. That and the other suggestion was just for you again, to probably have a look at what to do it by heat stroke.
45:29
That's another way to fix it, because again, we know with truth that's always going to be true.
45:42
And if P is true, true stroke true is going to be false.
45:47
Whereas false stroke true, which we know will be true, has the same values that.
45:53
So they might, in some cases will come will come to a bit later on,
46:12
but it might be useful sometimes to know how many functionally distinct human connexions you can build a construct for a given authority.
46:17
So in the case, for example, if I'm considering I connected with zero charity,
46:28
which means it doesn't take any proposition, awesome, you know that that might be. It can only take two possible values.
46:35
It can be the true or false. Whereas there's only two connectives there.
46:42
Whereas if you have a if you have, in that case, a single or generally connective, which I was in that case, it only takes one argument.
46:48
Then you can have four different truth tables that say you can imagine.
46:58
And question is there why? And meanwhile, members explain it here, so you can you can visualise this idea is that if I have one one proposition,
47:08
that is the one for me, it's like one one argument for a connective.
47:20
Then I know that I can I can construct essentially these four different truth tables where
47:24
in that way I will list what the different truth values that for that populism can take.
47:30
So it can only take the form you can take, which is either true or false in all cases.
47:35
And I can imagine that say that the the table on the far left,
47:39
I can imagine a connective that assigns true whenever P is true, but also signs to whenever P is false.
47:43
I can imagine another truth table which assigns always assigns pizza false regardless of what the truth value is.
47:52
And then you can imagine, vice versa. So it's true.
47:59
It gives us true if it's possible this post and the one on the far right, which is essentially like an inverse like flips.
48:01
OK. So in that sense, I know that there are four different, distinct connectives that I can build by considering a collective.
48:08
How many do you think I can build without some uniformity there?
48:19
But again, you can imagine already we know how many we can build using a binary collective, essentially.
48:23
But I just because I know it's a binary connective.
48:30
The general formula is going to be two to the power to dissolve to one, which we've got 16 different connectors.
48:32
Now, four of them, we've come across them, but we use a standard.
48:40
Obviously, the conjunction, the distinction, the implication,
48:44
the by direct implications we've seen already, the shift stroke one and there are other ones.
48:46
So these are all the different connectors, but we're really an important thing to think about.
48:51
They're different 16 different connectors. Why are we using all of them in logic, essentially?
48:56
Well, remember what we're trying to build, what we're trying to use?
49:01
Logic was the reason about what were the things that we're arguing about and the closest of
49:04
the standard ones that we use are ones which we express through those four different connect,
49:09
those four different binary connectors, essentially, and hence we don't typically use these other ones.
49:14
Most lasting or last thought I want to leave you guys with is this notion of functional completeness.
49:22
And the idea is that if you have a set of connectors, including connectors,
49:29
then we would say that that set is functionally complete in proposition logic.
49:35
And maybe I do want to stress that in throughout this lecture today and last time, I didn't always kind of qualify.
49:41
What I expressed were proposition logic for all but all the claims. All of the things that I'm saying is true for proposition logic.
49:50
We're talking about a different logic than some of the things I'm saying might, might not hold, so you'll need to just bear that in mind.
49:55
But the proposition logic will say that that set of connectors is functionally
50:02
complete if any connectivity of any arrietty can be defined just in terms of those.
50:07
OK, so like I've said before, is that I can actually define the shape of stroke.
50:14
We say it's mostly complete because I can define all the other connectors in terms of it.
50:19
But also, if I look at the set, which only contains not and conjunctions,
50:23
and that is also functionally complete because I can define all of the other connectors in terms of it.
50:32
So just to give a quick example before I leave you guys for the tutorial and also give you a break, and that if I consider,
50:38
for example, I've made the claim now that in fact, the set not and conjunction is functionally complete.
50:48
Now, can somebody tell me how I might express and define the race that is on that, how I might express, for example?
50:57
Disjunction using those two connectors only. Just.
51:12
Yep. And somebody trying to say something.
51:24
So my my question is I want to be able to express something like P and P or Q, but only using not and and the IQ and then negation of that.
51:29
Sorry, is both you and negation of that will not be.
51:43
So I guess you said an allegation of payment of that.
51:48
I'd be honoured if I'm not paid. And not you.
51:53
And then again. Exactly. Yes. OK, so how about implication?
51:59
So say I want to express instead that formula.
52:09
Any ideas? He really was.
52:14
I would be argue the not p or Q Q and we can replace the OR with what we just did above and sorry.
52:22
And then you kind of work your way from here, something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
52:34
OK, so just walk away. I'm not saying so, but essentially what you've done that any name transformation has moved.
52:38
Yeah. Okay, great. So we'll stop here and then we'll basically move on Tuesday to going to translations.
52:43
But what I would like to just add now is that you guys have a break and then we'll start again at five five o'clock will.
52:56
I'm assuming everybody will work through their schedule sheets here. What will you've got the tutorial?
53:04
Help us here.
53:10
And then the variations, the different story helpers, what I might do at some point throughout and I will let the other rooms know is that I will.
53:11
I might go through one of the questions. If I find that people are stuck on a certain point, then we might go on the board and walk through that.
53:20
But meantime, just have a break. And then and then we'll resume again at five o'clock.
53:26
This is was the recording and a break.
53:36
Obviously, the facts.
53:41
