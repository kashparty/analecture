Title: Week 1 - Introduction & Unassessed Diagnostic Exercise
Category: COMP40016 - Calculus (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 07/10/2021
Welcome, everyone, to the first. Well, it's not really a lecture, it's more of a session to the introductory session for for 16 and for 17 as well.
0:00
These two modules are linked, as I mentioned in my email yesterday, there will be a short unassessed exercise today.
0:11
It's meant to be a diagnostic to see what you remember from before.
0:21
And you don't have to worry about it. It's just going to be checked by your MMT tutor and it will be returned to you on week
0:25
three with some feedback on what you may need to revise or what you could further develop.
0:34
You should already have the link in my email. It should be an Ultrabook link directly pointing you to the test.
0:43
So as soon as you open it right now, you should be seeing a page saying for 16 calculous diagnostic exercise.
0:52
If you can't see this page, please let me know now and I will fix it.
1:01
Is the assessment open book? Yes, it is. You can use your calculator.
1:09
You can use whatever notes you may have just done, chat with others.
1:13
That's the only thing we ask of you. Don't collude, don't use the answers of others.
1:19
Don't start with your fellow classmates or friends.
1:25
So yeah, that's the only limit here.
1:30
OK, so is there someone who can't see this link?
1:36
I've also placed it in the SAT right now. Is there someone who can enter and see the front cover?
1:41
If so, just wave, raise your hand or message me and I'll fix it.
1:49
OK. So no, no hand, that's a good thing, um.
1:57
Yes, you can use a calculator. I got some questions here.
2:05
I got his calculator. That's fine. It's open book. It's fine.
2:08
Yes. Um, can I use answer book at the same time on my desktop and laptop and phone?
2:12
Yes, you can you can use on book at the same time.
2:19
That's how we built it.
2:23
You can open it on your laptop to download the specs and then you can open it on your phone and upload your photos from your phone.
2:25
So yeah, should be fine. Uh, do we need to work on camera to for monitoring.
2:35
No, we trust you. That's how we do it here.
2:41
And it worked fine last last year with trust you that you want collude.
2:45
And for exams that are assessed we will ask you to submit their ethics signature.
2:52
You have a specific form. We ask you to sign that you will be, you know, ethical, but that's for assessed ones.
2:59
For this one, we just trust you without any signatures. Um, what else can I find here?
3:07
Uh, can we write on a tablet instead of paper?
3:15
Yes. And you can then submit a screenshot of what you have written.
3:18
That's also fine. As long as it's a photo of some sort, that's fine.
3:23
Whatever you prefer to write, that's fine with us. Should we be seeing, uh, a front cover or just a message?
3:28
So you should be seeing a message that says the assessment has not yet started it.
3:37
And then at nine twenty, this will change. But so we enter for the username and password.
3:43
It's the one you use for Imperial. It's, uh.
3:51
Yeah, it's your call Con. It's your username without the Imperial.
3:54
I see. OK, it's just your username and your usual password. There is a fire drill at 10:00 during the tests.
3:59
What do I do? That's good to know. So that's tricky.
4:08
Um hmm. I wasn't aware of this in advance.
4:15
And, of course, um. Yeah. Right.
4:19
Um, I don't know if they said to ignore it, I mean, you are technically you have to follow the rules.
4:28
Um. Yeah, I would say, um, if you have been affected by this, so if you haven't finished by 10, if you think you need more time,
4:39
maybe you don't just email me afterwards and there will be an option and answer book to submit late.
4:53
And you can write the reasoning saying my fire alarm went off.
5:03
So I had to submit 10 minutes late, for example.
5:09
And then I will check with Woodward to get a list of the names to see who was affected and compare the two.
5:12
So there is a way to submit an answer book,
5:20
but you have to write to reason and then I have to confirm the reason why maybe you'll be finished way before then.
5:22
Yes. Do we have to stay in the jungle? No, you don't.
5:30
But maybe I will. You know, maybe we will realise that something's wrong in the spec and then the lecturer's will have to say something,
5:34
make an announcement like, oh, you know, question fifteen.
5:44
There's no question. Fifteen. So question fifteen needs to be changed, for example.
5:49
So it's up to you. Um, how do you access the exam.
5:53
The link is in the email. That's the front page. It's not an exam, it's an unassessed diagnostic exercise.
5:59
Please don't call it an exam. Thank you.
6:08
Uh, how can we write an iPad? Yes. You can write on an iPad and submit a screenshot.
6:12
Um, you will have to submit, um, every question, uh, separately.
6:18
So there's there's a specific number of questions for every question.
6:24
You should submit a single file. Don't submit everything at once.
6:29
OK, well, someone said there's no evacuation required, if that's true, that's fine,
6:37
but if they expect you to evacuate, please do not break any rules for the sake of this unassessed diagnostic tests.
6:43
Thank you, Sarah. Yes, exactly, um, we have two students with extra time.
6:56
Um, if you are that student, you will see that your answer book will not state 10 15.
7:04
It will state the new X for a time, which is twenty five percent, which means that will be ten, twenty nine.
7:12
If you don't see ten, twenty nine, it means we don't know that you require extra time.
7:21
So you need to speak with Thomas Lancaster, the Department of CERT,
7:26
for such issues that as I mentioned in my day one lecture and we can take this further.
7:32
So yeah. And if you're applauding for a question, I'm going to go back and change the answers.
7:38
Yes, you can. Yes, you can go back and change the answers.
7:44
So when you enter answer book, you will see it has like a like a top.
7:48
It looks like a time when every question has its own tab and just click to the right time.
7:53
You, you know, do what you want to do there and then you move to the other top.
7:57
It's not like a sequential thing. You can move back and forth.
8:02
Can we upload everything at once? If you mean at the end, I don't really suggest it because maybe, you know, a single delay can force you to miss out.
8:06
It's up to you, though. It's best not to upload everything in a single file.
8:20
So every question should be answered in a separate file.
8:24
And that's for your benefit, because then you want to lose everything at once if something goes wrong, touchwood with your connexion.
8:28
So just go in a question, upload the file. They're going the other question from the father.
8:36
Yeah. When you say open book doesn't include the Internet. Yes, the Internet is a book of knowledge.
8:42
No, some good, some not so good. But yeah, it is a book.
8:47
Yes. And can we use any browser? If you have any issues with specific browsers, then please use another browser.
8:52
We have trying to make an e-book work with any browser, but some people have reported issues with I believe it was Safari.
9:02
So maybe you can use Chrome and Firefox. I'm not sure whatever.
9:11
If you see that you can't upload the file and you would expect that the upload would finish
9:16
instantly and it doesn't just switch to another browser and it should address the issue.
9:22
The destination was supposed to be forty minutes, so it should have ended at ten,
9:27
but we extended the duration to ten fifteen to give you fifteen extra minutes to deal with any upload issues.
9:33
So technically speaking,
9:41
you shouldn't really need more than forty minutes to write up your answers and you still have fifteen extra minutes for uploading and such.
9:43
Is uploading a picture from a phone fine, yeah, I'm uploading a photo is fine as long as the light is the lightning and the room is
9:52
fine and the press tap on your screen to focus on the text so that it's not blurry.
10:00
You don't have to scan it. Right. It's an overkill. Maybe for exams.
10:06
You can worry about that. But if you have a good fun with a good camera and good lighting in the wrong, you should be fine.
10:10
Yes, great. OK, I think that's everything from my introduction, if you have any further questions,
10:18
post them in the chat or message me, e-mail me amongst teams as well.
10:31
Many ways to reach me now. I will leave the remaining eight minutes.
10:38
Sorry to the lecture, so introduce them. Thank you.
10:42
That's your cue, Paul and Serag. OK, maybe I'll just say, well, we'll formally welcome you to the calculus class next week,
10:54
and this is not this is not an attempt to somehow test the content of the of the course.
11:04
And we'll tell you about the linear algebra course.
11:14
It's actually the pre university mathematics, something that we would expect you to know before you start these courses in general.
11:18
But don't don't worry too much if there are things that you have forgotten that that's all right.
11:27
I think it's good to have a fair assessment of what you know, just for your own benefit.
11:32
So you know what you have to revise. But there is not this is not really an example.
11:37
This is as instantaneous has said, an assessment for your own benefit and don't stress too much about it.
11:42
It's just a piece of information. What you remember, what you don't remember.
11:50
You can use the Internet. But I mean, I think for your own information, if you end up sort of Googling too much,
11:54
that should give you an idea that perhaps there is something that you have forgotten. Right.
12:01
So for your own benefit, perhaps, don't you know if you Google specific answers to questions, then maybe there is something that you need to work on.
12:04
And it's better to ask us if you have forgotten something and talk to us if there is stuff that you have forgotten rather than cheat yourself and say,
12:14
well, if I can just Google the answer and just be fair to yourself.
12:23
And if there are things that you don't necessarily remember, you can talk to us and we should be able to help.
12:27
I don't really have much more to say. I just want to wish you good luck. Maybe Surak wants to address you as well.
12:35
Yeah, hi, I'm Tia, and I'll be teaching you linear algebra in the spring.
12:42
And just to add to what Paul and Constantinos have already said about the test.
12:48
The results of your test will also be used by your MMT duties to understand your background and and those duties will then,
12:56
according according to your performance in the diagnostic test, will shape or will run the tutorial sessions.
13:05
So if you cheat and you score full marks just because you found answers online, your tutor will assume that you are geniuses.
13:14
And then there but the the daughters may not be that useful because you may I may assume that you already know everything.
13:25
So it is for your benefit that you make a fair assessment not just for yourself,
13:37
but also for the tutor so that they can shape that it and according to the background of the student's.
13:44
And good luck and yeah, I think just a few more minutes and.
13:52
And you'll be starting your test, maybe you have any questions regarding the molecules themselves and you want to feel free to ask now.
14:02
You can also type in the chart, you have any questions? It's fine if you don't.
14:19
Yeah, we wouldn't last only because with this one, you mean the diagnostic would only be calculus.
14:25
It it will be pre university mathematics that are essential for calculus and linear algebra modules.
14:36
So I got a question from Chad. How can I find my MMT tutor so I will post a list of your tutors in the board, in the Edstrom board,
14:49
and then you will know how to reach out to them or they will reach out to you.
15:01
Um, it's either a staff member or it's the student.
15:05
So we'll post this link with their emails and you can reach out to them.
15:11
Sorry, is is this is this assessment's related to the deferral packages released yesterday, last night, last year.
15:17
I was released last year. I mean, that package packages this is Corsaro of Sessions.
15:29
Oh, no, this is an entirely separate thing. So this is very specific to these two modules.
15:39
And these two modules were not offered before now. So this is the first time we're offering that in this way.
15:45
So you will find that this is entirely unconnected to that.
15:52
OK, thank you. All right. What's show like for you working of all the problems or.
15:56
OK? That's a good question. Who wants to take it? Yeah, I it would it would be useful if you can show.
16:03
How did you reach the final answer. OK, another question from the chat.
16:09
What kind of assignments do we get for these modules? So it will be similar maths problems as coursework.
16:16
So I could take it home with you. Yes, based on what is taught in the lectures, you will have assignments.
16:24
It will be similar in nature, but there'll be there'll be different.
16:34
OK, one more question, can I take my answer as well?
16:39
There's no way there's no place for you to type your answers,
16:44
but what you could do is type them and then convert that file to an image or a PDF and upload that far.
16:47
However, I'm not sure how competent you are with typing formulae.
16:55
So, yeah, if you're up for the challenge, that's for sure.
16:59
Latex supports formula. There are some applications that do.
17:03
I don't know how you would do that without prior experience, but if you have the experience, please go ahead.
17:07
I don't suggest it if you haven't done it before. Yeah.
17:13
The platform keeps asking for my password. Yeah. So then that this should stop after one minute.
17:17
In a minute from now they should stop asking for your password.
17:25
OK, so would you recommend having the summary paper that we were sent early in front of us.
17:29
Um, what what's the summary paper? You mean like the list of formulae and stuff that we need to remember before we came out of that one?
17:36
I mean, you're welcome to have that in front of you as long as you actually remember them, that the tests should have started now.
17:46
So if you take answer back, if you refresh the page now, it should say that the assessment has started.
17:54
So you should be able to press the download paper button and actually see the questions of that assessment.
17:59
So this is a seven question assessment. OK.
18:07
And good luck. And yes, and upload pictures, you can just click on the question at the top, it says question one,
18:13
two, seven, and then it says drop files here or click to upload at the bottom of the question.
18:31
So that's where you do it. If you're on a laptop, click. If you're on your phone, just drop the.
18:37
