Amy. I might have to.
0:45
Jamie, OK, yeah, there's lots of echo now.
1:00
Angulated. Like feedback, feedback.
1:07
And. Right there with the.
1:19
Is it echoing from your voice or. The.
1:28
I'm not sure. And so the problem is, is that my mike died on my desktop.
1:35
So I'm using my tablets, my. Desktops already, so I that they're just going to pick up the desktops here.
1:45
As long as it's fun when you need it, then I guess go with that.
1:58
It looks, but I'm not hearing an echo from you when I talk, when I hear my own.
2:10
Yeah, that's why I expect that's just going to be an artefact of how I'm going to accomplish my
2:19
speakers through my tablet because I'm already doing something dodgy enough to get this to work.
2:27
I literally have a server running on my tablet like features connected to the webcam and audio.
2:35
Yeah. It's pretty. Out of this mostly being muted and it will be OK, fine, it's fine now, I don't hear it anymore.
2:43
So now that it's not the worst thing in the world.
2:59
OK. Chattanooga. He looks great as well.
3:09
You to screech, Eric, I'm sorry, but if you can just.
3:23
I did try it. What?
3:35
But you can also say that. So if there are links because one of them.
3:43
Is for me, which is going to be Windows smashed Linux version of this and a computer, you won't be able to live in country this year previously.
3:54
Just get me that. So, yeah, if you it's 11 a.m. it's time to stand up and it's not taxed.
4:08
So if you if you will not use that, you probably go to a little later on at the same time, we will be stuck in his room.
4:19
There might be a delay in the other room because the other house, as it is said, said it's.
4:28
Wow. Well done, best prepared. That's the.
4:44
You should prepare for anything. Uh, yeah, this thing is the quality on this thing, by the way, the sweet cherry.
4:51
For me, it's fine if anybody has issues. That because this is quite a high resolution, are two small.
5:02
They can try and make it the country that again.
5:14
The text. Is that enough?
5:21
Yeah, should be fine. OK, well, make it even bigger and then remember how to make it smaller again.
5:28
It applies to all of them. No. So I think we'll wait a few more minutes for people to be able and now.
5:39
Let's get it on. Yes, I just introduce myself.
5:59
In the meantime, I'm Jamie.
6:14
It'll probably be seeing quite a fair amount of people this year and next year and then from Thursday, one up just disappear off the.
6:17
But I'm a GTA, which means I'm a graduate teaching assistant and I help on the on the first year and second year main website.
6:27
So let me ask my credentials for that is quite good.
6:40
I've been a student at high school now for three years and I've been using Haskell for up to three or four that.
6:44
So I can try and the noise cancelling, we can hope everyone starts really and yeah,
6:55
I'll also be helping out on the operating systems and co-pilots stuff next year.
7:04
Do I sound robotic? Put down the noise cancelling.
7:12
It's what I can do. I can switch my audio. So not.
7:25
During an. That is not the.
7:32
Not really so, but the best thing we're having a technical difficulty with using the same can and.
7:48
Well, I don't think I can get any less robotic,
8:03
maybe it's just me and some of the bush sounds like the most Catholic and so they should be anything affecting my voice at such.
8:06
But, um, yeah.
8:17
Was cutting back on it. They start drilling again, which been enjoying style.
8:24
You can still understand what I'm saying, even if I sound a bit weird. So on the left side.
8:34
Apologies for the late. Uh uh.
8:53
I think we can start this discussion because there seems to be more people throwing me me.
9:20
Will, let me take the floor. Would you be using your job opportunities, Mark?
9:29
Well, if you do particular, Mac, you're probably going to be using Linux so you can just stay here.
9:37
Um, so, yeah, this system works for if you have an actual Linux installation or you're using Windows and you want
9:43
to quickly talk over the options that you have there and what I'm using and what was being quoted,
9:53
I think it's being recorded now. This is all the right.
10:00
I definitely am. OK, so I think it is recording and hopefully the listener can figure out what's what's the difficulties with the microphone.
10:15
But for now, there's not much difference between Mac and Linux for this stuff.
10:32
So you can follow along here and straightforwardly just try stuff out of your machine as you're doing it.
10:39
And I think it will become a bit more important to the next session anyway.
10:46
That's when they'll start to sort of diverge a bit more. So for now, you'll probably be fine here.
10:50
I can I can handle all your requirements, so.
10:56
Basically, at the moment, as you can see, I am a witness, this is a Windows machine,
11:02
though, because the muscles what I'm using here is the Windows terminal.
11:11
And you can notice probably I've got a bunch of different options here, so I've got the normal Windows command prompt.
11:16
That's what you're probably used to seeing if you type C and D.
11:24
And I've also got these Linux ones so abundantly OK, which is the first one I made.
11:29
So what I'm using is called the Windows subsystem phonetics.
11:35
Lots of code of USL, specifically two.
11:41
Now what that means is I'm basically I got windows to stop this built in letters kernel and it sort
11:46
of allows me to use Linux within Windows without needing to duplicate or run a virtual machine.
11:56
So it's really fast and it's sort of very compatible with windows.
12:01
So that is my recommended way of doing things.
12:09
You could use Windows and Linux just like you can put Mac in the next, but is much easier to set up and deal with.
12:11
From what I remember yesterday, I think these days Microsoft has made the situation seamless and you can basically just run out
12:23
that stuff and install on a on administrator command prompt and it will start the process going.
12:32
And there is instructions online about how to do that. But it is difficult and it's it's how I recommend we do things.
12:39
Now, the caveat at the moment is that we don't have any DIY applications in Windows and Windows 11 because this is out as of yesterday.
12:48
But if you haven't received the update,
13:03
it might take some time to be an update from those 10 this month that will enable graphical user interface was that they don't have Windows 11 yet.
13:04
So what that would mean is you can actually run Linux programmes as actual
13:16
Windows and Windows at the moment instead of restricted to the terminal box,
13:22
which people still talk about tomorrow. So, Adam, so what is the next Linux is is a kernel and there are many operating systems built on top of it.
13:29
The one we recommend is unta. That's the one Microsoft will definitely install for you when you do WSO if you do that yourself.
13:41
So inside this world, which you can see from this very small penguin here, I'm working on the next.
13:48
So everything I type inside this box is equally applicable to Linux as it is Windows.
13:54
So so this will probably look familiar to you two terminals if you've got the TO installed, probably the same colour scheme.
14:00
Are there any questions about that at this point? So even if black.
14:12
Is that OK, if you're watching this and yes, most of the commands work similarly on Mac and Linux,
14:19
that would not be true if I were just using plain Windows.
14:29
But thankfully, I'm not I would not recommend, by the way, that anyone knew just plain windows to do any programming on.
14:32
It is a nightmare. So this is the best solution here.
14:37
So you'll be able to follow along with most of the basic commands and stuff.
14:42
And you can hop over when you when it's ready. And hopefully that will be fine.
14:46
Would it be best for us to, like, log onto the computer and then like you from Linux over there, if we don't have it installed on our own computer?
14:55
Yes. If you don't want to install it yourself. And like I said, it's very straightforward.
15:05
It's very easy. Yes. You can access the school computers to do that stuff.
15:09
I won't talk about that a bit more tomorrow and how to work on effectively.
15:16
But yeah, essentially you'll be limited to using come on line text editors and stuff unless you're using voice code.
15:22
That's that's the story for tomorrow. You can definitely do that. And I will show you how to do that as well today.
15:31
I basically just want to start off with is just handling a bunch of the Linux commands and familiar with how it works.
15:39
This will be true equally if we're running on this machine here or any other Linux machine, which includes the lab machines.
15:49
So I'm going to get started by just familiarising ourselves with where we are.
15:58
So at the moment, the way these things usually work is it tell me who I am,
16:06
what machine this happens to be called Leviathan and what direction I'm in at the moment.
16:11
The directory is called it's the whole directory.
16:16
The command on can help tell you where you are. So the directorate is also known as forward slash home.
16:21
So if I were to go there with KDDI, it takes me to the exact same place.
16:32
So that is just where I am now.
16:37
KDDI dot com. It's going to take me to the same place as well.
16:42
So basically stands by wherever you are at this moment in time, you can also get hired by details.
16:45
So the other special one I want to quickly show is not.
16:53
So that takes you back up to directory.
17:01
So at the moment we're at home slash GMT dot dot is just going to be home and lo and behold, dot dot ends up going to the home.
17:03
And I can sit back and Jamie and the was to tilt, so I'm sorry to interject for a second.
17:16
The mcauslan should be up. It's in the chat.
17:24
If somebody could kindly circulated it to the other first year students.
17:28
If you have a group chat, I would be nice. I'm sorry for their service issues.
17:32
Yeah, that's cool.
17:41
So just the basics of moving around. Now, another group commander, how about how else?
17:47
Let's start with the list, it tells us what files and folders are found in our current directory.
17:55
Quickly, do as I am going to fill my background with black.
18:05
Maybe we can easily see this. So these things in blue are going to be basically in my folders and then the things in the files I have in here.
18:12
So essentially there are a few more of them.
18:23
You can use that a you can. I've also got a bunch of stuff that starts with dots.
18:27
So the conventional index is that these are hidden, hidden files just for cleanliness,
18:32
sake, debate and bunch of stuff that you don't need to be too concerned with at the moment.
18:39
And so if I go out to home and I do, unless we can find out that the only place I can go to in here is called Jamy, which is my home folder now.
18:46
Is it like this? Yes, I like the idea. I think that's the one anyway.
18:59
So I just want to quickly illustrate this is a bit special because it has access to the entire windows fastest.
19:06
Yes, that's exactly what I was about to say. So this is where we are at the moment, is inside the Lenox filesystem.
19:17
They asked. They're kept separate and now in like windows you'd say something like C, drive forward, slash, blah, blah, blah, blah.
19:26
And so they have a special, special way mentioning this, and it is via slash and then T stands for Mt.
19:35
So now to drive C or F or whichever one of the poorest people.
19:45
So it's actually.
19:52
I think so, yeah. That is my actual windows directly into my afterlife.
19:57
So that's how you can, you can get to the windows folders. If you want to get the Linux for the Windows, you get to go via the Windows Explorer.
20:07
Basically Windows separates them happily via network drive, basically.
20:19
The thing about those programmes inside it by using E so I can actually open that in Windows Explorer by doing XY dot.
20:26
And this is the same thing that we saw before. That's the same, the same files and things.
20:40
And you can see basically how this has worked as it's mapped to this network drive WSO about to add preconceive.
20:48
That's probably a bit small, but I can't really do anything to increase that font size.
20:58
And basically you can access it completely normally via via this stuff in here.
21:02
So this is how you would get around the file system when Windows seven plans for you automatically,
21:11
when you'll be able to use a mix file browser instead, which will directly to it.
21:16
And why is the homes left rather than homes,
21:24
largely because there are multiple people and I think they've just chosen to to just call them homes because everyone lives there.
21:28
And so this is really what you need to know about the interaction between windows and doors.
21:39
You can open these files in the two.
21:44
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to switch to a fresh place is one I prepared earlier post docs.
21:48
OK, that looked like them cheekily. It's actually Stoeckle Jamie.
21:58
That's fine. So this is a fresh version of Atlanta and it's so fresh it doesn't even have GHC in it.
22:02
So yeah, this is about as fresh as you get and illest nothing.
22:12
This is a clean slate. Actually, there is a few things in here, but otherwise it's basically a free flight,
22:17
so stop demonstrating some of these commands and play around with them interacting with Windows and Linux to show that it can be done.
22:29
So I used to command it, touched the touch, basically do much better.
22:39
Firewall doesn't exist. It will make it so if I touch Hollowell dot text, nothing, nothing actually happens.
22:45
But you will see that HelloWallet text now exists in my home directory and there it is in in the windows and the windows thing here.
22:55
So there it is. It is a completely empty text file.
23:08
So I'm just going to put something in it on windows just so that that can be done.
23:13
So how can I see what's inside this file? So there was a few different options for this on Linux.
23:18
So one of them is Cat. So Cat had a lot of text.
23:24
It's just going to put the whole thing into the terminal.
23:28
And I can also use less and less basically would allow me to sort of scroll through a bit more controlled.
23:33
Obviously, the entire file fits in one line here, so it doesn't really make a difference.
23:43
So that's roughly how you can print out files.
23:50
There's also text editors I recommend no matter what I do, you may have to install that or not.
23:55
Something comes by default just to uninstall it and so is my go to text editor the terminal stuff,
24:02
because it's a bit less appreciative than they will Emax.
24:11
But but I can edit the files on this command line and if I go back and open them up, they have been changed so the two can interact with each other.
24:16
And that's what I want to cover all the interaction between the two of them that yeah, well, I try guess nothing comes up.
24:29
So if you try and I said nothing comes up, that's because you don't have any files yet.
24:37
And so if I remove Hanawalt text and I do ls there is just nothing there that NSWRL tells me.
24:42
There's absolutely nothing to see in here at all.
24:55
I love that they will tell me that there actually really is two things, but they're hidden by default.
25:00
So what is this command, what is it like because before I doing stuff and I could see these things so I left us.
25:07
L-A also tells you a bit more information about about the things that you can find in this folder, including when they were last modified,
25:13
how big they are, who made them, who owns them, various things like that and the access permissions.
25:26
So I think that there's a good description of this on the on the accompanying slides for this lecture roughly.
25:34
You know, they're talking about who can read and write them, execute them, various various other things.
25:42
So that going be important, the, you know, protecting your unfortunately users.
25:49
So where were we? So let's touch.
25:58
Let's touch. Hello again. So then we got to realise now how a lot of that text exists again and there isn't anything in it, so it's completely empty.
26:02
So what I want to show now is how we can manipulate these files.
26:18
So I'm going to demonstrate them died.
26:26
So EMK dynamic's directories, names, logging stuff is hard, isn't it?
26:34
OK, so this is a directory called Text Files here.
26:45
It's hard to know it's a directory. So what if I wanted to move this inside here?
26:51
Well, one way you could do that is opening the Windows Explorer in this thing and moving it manually.
26:59
So if you wanted to buy that cat and otherwise, there are a few commands for manipulating these things.
27:07
So someone's on. Where are the slides, when are they going to be hosted? OK, let's you could probably ask the.
27:17
So Cosentino should have somehow given you access to the notes for this scenario, like typed notes rather than slides, is just a demo of this stuff.
27:25
And then that's. Little. I don't I don't actually have access to what the first year students see, so.
27:36
If the notes haven't actually been provided, then.
27:46
I guess I put it in little chat. Yeah, I think the recording should go up on Panopto as well, right?
27:52
Yeah. So the recordings I'm currently recording and later I will I will coordinate with stuff like that.
28:03
So that should be fine. Yep.
28:11
And so I believe that I could find their way somewhere eventually.
28:16
OK, so what we did, we were moving things around so and so there are three demands of note.
28:22
Yeah. One is all we've already seen that the league statement stands for remove the other one is C that stands for copy.
28:31
This will physically make copies. So we'll see that in a minute. And M.V. start to move, physically move things around.
28:43
So what I'll do is I will move out of the text into text files.
28:51
And if I don't, there is nothing here. If I text files had a lot of text.
29:00
Is that now you can also you move to printing things.
29:07
So if you move hello, I'll text into text, you know, just feed off.
29:16
Text is not the file in there. Hello. Jobs have disappeared and I can also do that when I'm not in the directory as long as I'm sort of specifying.
29:24
So that's the way this works the other way around.
29:37
Let me make this too.
29:41
Oh, so the way this works is if you just sort of specify directories, the second element, it just gets violated without changing its name.
29:46
If you give it a different filename, it will move it there and rename it.
29:57
And what happens if you move the file into an existing file? Well, let's try it out.
30:02
So let's make a new file in here.
30:08
I'm just going to pop some stuff in it. I'll talk about text editors next time.
30:14
So don't worry if you don't know how I just did that, I'll talk about that in the next session.
30:22
Also, there's an edit, the text files text.
30:32
So they both contain different things, so the text contains just one and text files, all the text contains just two.
30:40
So what happens if I move that into the part of text?
30:52
Wow. Federal tax is now disappeared.
31:00
And if I cut that, we got text one, so replace it.
31:05
So be careful with that. They didn't ask for permission before we did this so that you have to be a little bit careful.
31:11
So what about some deep sleep would allow me to take that text and put it into this directory.
31:18
And now we have the text in here and another text within our rights that doesn't delete the original one.
31:29
It removes it as well. This can also rename things.
31:38
And so if I do the text through the text city, we got both of them and they'll have identical contracts, contents.
31:41
So I've thought of how to manipulate these these files or the command line.
31:56
So like I said, you know, we can equally do these things in Windows Explorer or in the actual Linux file manager when that's available to us.
32:02
I think this month. Sometimes this month, Windows will update and you'll be able to just access your Linux file system over the next file Explorer.
32:14
That, yeah, you know, it works the same way as it does out here, and I can relate to this and they will contain that one.
32:26
So, you know, you can you can do things like windows, obviously, during the next year, just going to be the next flight explorer.
32:37
So few other important things. So one of them, you're not going to be able to put on the lap machines.
32:46
So everything we've seen so far, we can tell that machines there's an important come on Sudan and it basically elevates your rights and privileges.
32:55
Obviously, you can't you and she will show you what it says so that you don't have to do it yourself a bit later than necessary into one of them.
33:05
And so it is quite useful if you need to steal stuff.
33:16
Sorry to interject again. I think the Zoome call will automatically add because it's a free account, so.
33:21
When it ends, just rejoined back. Yeah, but, uh, no, I'm not sure if they if they still do that,
33:31
maybe that's force forcefully and I want everyone to join them again and we'll continue.
33:40
So I stood out and I told to basically do things that otherwise you wouldn't have been allowed to do.
33:48
A couple of this include installing stuff. So the way to install stuff is to act.
33:54
So let's see what happens. One installed. Why don't you do subjects in Salt Lake not found?
34:01
OK, so make it something you'll be using for see, it's down the line that it's convenient because it's not been installed.
34:13
And usually if you come on, that you don't have installed limits will often tell you where to find it.
34:21
Sometimes it doesn't quite to work out what you want it. Sometimes it can just give you these commands.
34:28
So we do this and run it up.
34:33
I'll be asked to enter my actual department as it will install some stuff at this point.
34:39
Make now works. So that's how you basically install stuff in Linux.
34:48
You can install stuff on the machines in that same way. But yeah, that's probably how the system works.
34:53
Could you just repeat the installation? But yeah, that's fine.
35:00
I'm just going to get rid of some of that junk.
35:04
Wow, it's going to get rid of that junk. That's fine.
35:13
Yes, the installation part was sort of wrapped in Salt Lake,
35:24
so the syntax for this command still don't allow you to do Administrative Things Act, which is the package manager for.
35:30
But yes, Sutherlands mentioned it depends on the district. It absolutely does.
35:37
So for a bunch of which is the one we recommend using its APT and others have different different package managers,
35:42
installers saying that this is something you want to actually go ahead and install.
35:51
Make is the name of the tool or package, what's at the end.
35:55
So act as a package manager. So basically the way it works chooses to do things because they have these large repositories for pre pre-built binaries.
35:59
And Act is one of these sort of big places.
36:11
So you basically ask out how to install make plays and it's like, well, here's the binary for make and it does all the necessary setup.
36:15
Is there a way to make every command you do? It's provided to the studio every time.
36:26
Yeah. You can either sue to get into a single user.
36:31
I think if you the good thing is, is that when you do see the once in a session, you enter your password.
36:34
Every time you do start ups, you don't see how you can add your stuff into a super user that is like safer to use, hopefully.
36:42
And installing a bunch of crap,
36:57
so so something that's quite important then the fact is actually it doesn't have the most up to date things by default every
37:00
now and then you want to consider up to date and that will go and fetch the most up to date package lists from from the to.
37:08
So it's basically going to a place which has all these things, and that means that you get the most up to date information.
37:23
Then if stuff upgrading it will tell you to sort of upgrade.
37:34
In my case, it's going to wait until this is done, but in my case I'm already up to date.
37:39
So this will basically do nothing. And as you can see, you can't run apps updating or installing twice at the same time.
37:46
So I do have to wait for this one to finish, which might take a while.
37:54
So I'll just leave it running. So, yeah, that's pseudo.
37:59
So this is useful for your machines on the lab machines. Stuff's already installed in.
38:04
Not going to need to do it yourself. And so.
38:08
So everything I really wanted to come would act as well. So what's the difference between acting out?
38:17
Get a good question and get is just old. I think it's a legacy.
38:23
And so I think they're apt to just more up to date.
38:29
I don't think they usually just will work and I tend to favour at primary because I'm lazy.
38:34
I don't want to take the task. And it it's like.
38:42
How do you deal with those either through cell or something like mock up shadows and still run in windows?
38:46
But I recommend using a cell. I don't recommend using the the Windows terminal, which can be installed by the App Store Windows seven.
38:56
It's just nicer and it keeps everything in one place. So I got everything I need.
39:09
You don't start that sort of.
39:14
I think something is also worthwhile demonstrating is pipe commands as well.
39:20
So what do we got here? We got some tax cuts. What can you install the cell?
39:26
Where can you find the install instructions and think if you just Google for installing a cell, that will be a matrix.
39:31
But that one that docs dot Microsoft in thought up your cell.
39:38
How do you use that when, say, into the lab machines, I will show that in a bit.
39:44
It's just like, no. You just need to get that first.
39:50
So I'll just demonstrate these biting plants and then we will go over to the machine and see what the difference is with that.
39:54
Started at the.
