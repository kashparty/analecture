Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
Date: 02/02/2022
All right. People in Zoom.
0:05
Am I audible? And is the screen visible?
0:09
Yes. Yes. And this then we can see your screen perfect.
0:14
Great. All right. Yeah. So last time we stopped that, we stopped short of meeting their independence.
0:21
We talked about it.
0:32
The vector spaces we talked about make the spaces, the bases.
0:38
No, no, we didn't talk about bases. If we come up today.
0:44
So we talked about vector spaces and the sub spaces and and I think I stopped at a very important theatre,
0:49
which an important mathematical truth, which is that any subspace of a vector space is actually.
1:01
A solution to a system of linear equations unwise of us and so.
1:12
So let me read that statement. So if is is the centre of all vectors such that?
1:17
All vectors are in such that. So let s end, because it depends on the Matrix eight, where E X equals zero,
1:33
so set of all solutions to this to the system of linear equations, which is represented by this equation.
1:49
Now, this solution said. Is a subspace?
2:01
So I should say it's a. Along with this, the standard operation addition operation and the standard scalar multiplication and event space.
2:15
Along with the zero vector. Is a subspace?
2:31
Of end and vice versa, which is to say that giving any sub space of in.
2:39
It it is a solution space for some system of genetic reasons.
2:48
We showed the implication in one direction. Oops!
2:55
We showed that any solution will be a safe space.
3:11
You just need to check if it's closed and the extradition goes on a scale of multiplication.
3:16
But to show the other way around, I will introduce a new concept.
3:21
Of basis, so. And linear independence, so.
3:27
So first, let's talk about linear independence. We said even before linear independence, we need to talk about linear combination of vectors.
3:35
All right, so. Previously, we have seen that any given Victor.
3:48
S bond, which would be. X one x two.
3:56
It's in. Can be written as a one time.
4:02
One heart rate one zero zero. All the way down. Plus extra times.
4:08
Zero one zero. All the way down and so on.
4:16
End times. Zero zero one.
4:24
On the right hand side, what you see is a linear combination of these vectors, so you're.
4:31
These are the vectors. This is a scalar coefficient.
4:38
I. This whole thing is what is called a linear combination.
4:47
Off the standard basis vectors. OK.
4:55
So simply put. So this was only a standard basis.
5:07
But in general, I could have had any other way. Yes, good on this basis, but it seems informal.
5:11
Very effective. Yes. One heart vector and the standard basis this this new same name.
5:18
Different names for the same. So these.
5:25
Of course, standard basis. Or one hot.
5:36
Because. And any given Victor in the orange space is a linear combination of the standard basis.
5:46
But let's extend this concept to any kind of vectors.
5:59
So suppose you have. Let's say you have gay different vectors or just as an example, I'll use three.
6:03
I'll just say, let's say it is one reactor bees, another victor sees another vector belonging to some odd and space.
6:21
Then just a linear combination would be. Something on the form, Lambda A.
6:32
A scalar of a scalar multiplication or scaling of a.
6:43
Plus. Another scaling of the vector to be.
6:48
Plus. Another scaling of vectors, see?
6:58
OK. And this would result in some vector, let's call it be.
7:05
So on the left is what is called a linear combination of the three vectors A, B and C, and on the right is what you get.
7:19
The right is the output of this linear combination.
7:29
We also see that this vector B depends on a, b and C because you can get B in terms of ABN C,
7:35
so we can also this is this also means that the Vector B.
7:49
Depends. On.
7:58
A. B and C and similarly, if if we can just rearrange the whole equation as we can, we can show that it will also depend.
8:06
On. B. C.
8:26
And B, you can just flip the big bag,
8:31
the Vecteurs B and C the terms Lambda B Times B Vector plus lambda c c Richter on the other side, divide by lambda eight.
8:37
And what you have is eight in terms of B, C and D vectors, right?
8:47
So in other words, all four of these vectors are linearly dependent as they are all dependent on each other.
8:53
OK. So to generalise this concept, this notion of linear dependence, we see.
9:00
Back. I should I should have mentioned that you need to ensure that the land that not all land, that not all coefficients are zero.
9:10
That would be too simple. I think the director need it shouldn't be too late.
9:25
You are only dealing with non-zero goes with non-zero coefficients, at least one non-zero coefficient.
9:30
All right. So we say that in this case, we will say that does A, B, C and B.
9:37
Are linearly dependent. If Lambda A.
9:50
Eric, thanks a. Lambda Be.
10:05
Times be less glamorous, see time, see less.
10:10
Lambda B Times D. Is equal to zero.
10:16
Implies that this is only possible if all the coefficients are.
10:25
I should have. Implies Lambda Air is equal to lambda, B is equal to lambda, C is equal to lambda, B is equal to zero.
10:34
That is to say that this equation will be true only if the coefficients are zero and there is no other solution.
10:48
Yes. What about the power sector?
10:55
So. Status.
11:00
So if A and B are in the same direction, then the skills have to be zero.
11:09
Did I say linear? I define linear independence. Sorry.
11:19
So. My back, I made a mistake, I have defined linear independence.
11:24
What I should have said if if there is a non-trivial solution.
11:33
OK, OK, OK, OK, good. Let me rub this once again and repeat this.
11:40
Right. So it depends on what we say is that if some linear, if there exists some linear combination of all four vectors in this case.
12:07
Plus, Lambda B times B, there's no C Dempsey slammed the famous D.
12:22
OK, if there is a linear combination, which equals zero when.
12:32
Not all. They're not. All Lamb dies.
12:43
Zero. OK, then. A, B C.
12:54
And be. Are. Linearly dependent.
13:03
OK. And if you can't find this, then we say these pictures are linearly independent.
13:17
If you can't find a non-trivial coefficients by non-trivial, you mean the coefficients lambda a lambda b lambda seen on the B.
13:24
These coefficients are the scaling factors. Are not all zero one of them or at least two of them, you need at least two of them to be non-zero.
13:36
In that case, you will see that these vectors are linearly dependent.
13:47
If they are all zero and and if that is the only possible solution to this equation.
13:53
Where the coefficients have to be zero, then we see that these factors are linearly independent.
14:01
And now this is easy to visualise what this is. It's very easy to have an intuitive feel of what we mean by linear independence and dependence.
14:08
I do that geometrically. Let's have and let's build our intuition around it.
14:16
So. Let's consider the three dimensional or three.
14:24
Space. All right. And let's say there is a.
14:38
OK. This is one recorder. It is, but I don't know.
14:46
One, two three. OK. Just to be on three, two one, just to be a little bit accurate.
14:52
All right. Let's see. This is my reactor eight, and I create another reactor.
15:06
Which is along the line, passing through a. But perhaps somewhere here.
15:19
This is my Vector B. All right.
15:27
And this is perhaps nine.
15:31
Six three. OK. So any point which lies on the line can be obtained from me by simply scaling it.
15:37
Right. So. In particular, I can say be the Victor B is simply three times a box, so I could appeal Vector B from eight.
15:49
So B was dependent on it, or it lies on the same vector space which has been generated by Vector.
16:04
Write this line, this entire line, the blue line.
16:15
Can be generated by single vector eight, so every point on that line.
16:21
Depends on a or can be obtained from me, so every point on that line, every reporter on that line.
16:26
Along with it is it is entirely dependent on. So this is easy to understand.
16:33
When it's when it's just a line now, imagine that. Now let's let's consider another way to see somebody here.
16:39
Which is equal to one, two three. Now, see.
16:52
Cannot be represented in terms of any Victor on this line, including.
17:02
OK, see, will not be equal to lambda e for all lambda.
17:08
For whatever lambda you choose, whatever scalar value you choose, you will never be able to opt in c in terms of a.
17:15
Right. So in this case, we see that Richter, C. and Victor A.
17:24
Are linearly independent. OK.
17:33
All right. Right now, imagine if I did all possible linear combinations of air and sea together.
17:47
What we like. Yes. That's not true.
17:58
Yes. You get a plane which which is a vector space, but it's its plane, which is.
18:03
Which which covers all possible points that can be obtained from AMC.
18:14
Yeah. So you can imagine it's going to be a play. Passing through the origin at some angle with each axis.
18:20
All right. Then we see that that plane so so this line, first of all, this one dimensional line, which was coloured in blue.
18:28
I can't I have we have a special word for this line in terms of to say that this line is defined.
18:48
It's called the span of a.
18:55
OK. It stopped working.
19:06
The things I wrote just now are not visible on the street.
19:17
Yes. That's the problem with the audio issues on your iPod.
19:37
Yeah, but it's connected with all the devices, which is the problem.
19:47
It goes off and on. And.
19:59
We. OK.
20:32
Anyway, I have so far defined linear dependence and linear independence of vectors.
20:42
And I will also give you, given you any illusion that when you have linearly independent directors, you can generate a space out of those vectors.
20:53
A vector space out of those vectors. What comes next?
21:04
What we call those generating those basis?
21:11
So whenever you your bases like standard bases, they generate the entire space of, at any rate, the one heart rate goes.
21:15
Yes. What's the standard rate?
21:24
So the standard base is just a name that we give for the one heartbreak business.
21:29
The most obvious choice to have a basis like you would not generate space using, say, the vector one on one and the vector.
21:33
Minus one gunman, one. All right. It's it's not it's unusual, although they do represent the same space.
21:45
Both of these again, I think I'll need the board, but.
21:55
If technology allows us. Both these bases.
22:01
The the standard basis and this new set of basis are representing the same space.
22:12
But it's just that the standard bases are more in the more obvious choice.
22:19
Yeah. It looks like I could lose my licence.
22:22
Stylus is not this stylus. You mean this?
22:34
Yeah, I'm not, but I can just make arrows.
22:39
Yeah, I can detect you. Is it now possible?
22:47
On the. Is it possible to people on Zoom knowing it doesn't show and Zoom?
22:53
Now, obviously. All right, we have talked about independence and independence, so perhaps we can just go to the questions I had in the.
23:08
Slate. All right. So. Can anyone saw the first problem?
23:34
There are three reactors. X1.
23:44
Yeah. There are three vectors X1,
23:49
X2 and X3 x1 S2 minus one three X2 is one one minus two extremes three minus three and eight are what is what is the standard way of solving this?
23:51
You would. You would use a linear combination of the three.
24:07
OK. Maybe London Times, X1 Plus London two times X2 plus lambda, three times x three equals zero.
24:14
You get that one equation. And tried to solve that equation to find the values of the coefficients lambda one, lambda two a number.
24:22
If you conclude that those coefficients have to be zero and there is no other possibility.
24:31
Then you claim that then you say that the tree that goes up linearly independent.
24:41
But if you can find a solution, which is a non-trivial non-zero solution to this linear equation,
24:47
then we say that the three equations are legally dependent. Now you will soon realise that when you do it.
24:55
The fact that we it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of effort.
25:04
Using Gostin elimination, we can conclude it much faster,
25:10
it leaves our computers like MATLAB or whatever software you use, or perhaps something that you may develop on your own.
25:14
We'll be able to do or evaluate linear combination and study a linear dependent and independent directors much faster using caution illumination,
25:23
the same process that they use the Solar System of the questions,
25:32
how I would have shown you that if if the iPad was connected to the internet, OK, now it is so.
25:37
Let me go back. OK, now it's going to be in the spring and I'll move everything out of the way.
25:52
We are checking the checking weather x one x two x three are linearly dependent or independent, so I simply write.
26:25
Lambda, one times x one plus lambda, two times x two, slammed three times x three equal to zero and solve this for you,
26:44
find the values of the coefficients lambda one lambda two lambda three.
27:00
And. So you'll get number one.
27:06
What we'll the is. No one thanks.
27:17
Two minus one. Three. Close land are two times one one minus two.
27:30
Plus, Lambert, three times. T minus one T minus three eight.
27:43
OK. This would imply.
27:56
How would we go about solving this? You'll get a system of linear equations, right?
28:03
You'll get. Two times Lambda, one plus two plus three, lambda three equals zero.
28:09
This is the first equation. You'll also get minus lambda one.
28:19
Plus, Lambert to. Minus three Lambda three as your second equation.
28:25
And the third equation would be three times Lambda one plus lambda two.
28:34
So. Minus two times Lambda, two plus eight times lambda three equals zero.
28:41
You solve these three equations and find the values of the fine, find the values of lambda one number two and number two.
28:51
But as you have already realised,
29:02
this is a system of linear equations and solving a system only equation using abortion elimination is much faster or rather easier.
29:05
What will that Gorshin elimination approach look like?
29:17
It would look like a matrix consisting of. The directors to.
29:20
Minus one three. One, one two.
29:30
Three minus three, eight. It's one one minus two.
29:36
You're right. One, one, minus two.
29:43
This is my ex one. This is external.
29:49
And this is. Extreme right.
30:00
This is. Multiplied by the reactor number one, Lambda two, Lambda three.
30:06
Equals zero zero zero. And.
30:14
Solving using body elimination involves going up, getting the reduced rate on form and then solving it.
30:18
But you need not go all the way down. All right.
30:26
If you can conclude that the reduced Ecklund floor has three pillars in this case.
30:30
All right. If each column has a pivot, that would imply that it's a that the only possible solution to this system of linear equations is.
30:38
Zero zero zero. I don't. There is a unique solution if there is that, if all authentic, if all columns are perfect.
30:52
So we need not go all the way to get the reduced rate on.
31:07
You just need to know how many permits are there when you apply a limited operation.
31:11
So let's try and let's do it for this example. I can.
31:20
What can we do? We can. We can multiply the second row by two and add to the first row.
31:33
We can OK. I can take road two and then take two times Road two plus roll one.
31:45
I can also. Egg Roll three.
31:55
And make two times Rule three, minus three times at all one.
32:00
OK, this way. I will get.
32:07
Two, one three. This will become zero, this will become zero.
32:12
Three. For my friends, I think minus five.
32:19
I'm one of.
32:26
So minus seven. T-minus minus two six and.
32:33
Minus nine. A 16.
32:42
Minus nine, 16, minus nine. Right.
32:48
The crazy rich ones minus three. Plastics.
32:54
It will be minus six plus three and not minus 10.
33:02
OK. And then I continue to carry out more operations.
33:09
Yeah. Yeah. See, if you if you if I take the third rule.
33:25
She's. If I take the third row and replace it by three times the third row mine or plus seven times the second row,
33:32
I will get the third row to be to consist of only zeros.
33:45
Right. Let me make some space.
33:51
If I take the third rule and replace it by three times that hard rule minus a plus seven times the second rule, then you'll get a matrix.
34:06
Which has zero zero zero you. OK.
34:19
And there are some two one three zero three minus three.
34:24
OK. This is a matrix you get. How many permits does this have this one?
34:31
And this is a private. OK. The third row does not have a permit.
34:38
So there are two perfect for three.
34:47
Columns, which which basically means that the three factors are linearly dependent y because of the title being because there are only two permits.
34:52
This third column, we correspond to a free variable.
35:07
The moment you have a free variable, you have in finite. You won't have a unique solution, because that third variable can take any value.
35:13
OK. Right.
35:24
That's the reason behind. Using this technique of just review of using an elimination process just to identify how many pivots you get.
35:28
And once you know how many pivots you have, you can deduce whether this system will have a unique solution altering predictions.
35:39
And if it has a unique solution,
35:47
that solution has to be a zero sum the the conditions being zero simply because this is a homogeneous system of plenary,
35:49
which on the right hand side that Albies all constants are zero, so any operation on those values will return to zero.
35:57
So a unique solution for a homogeneous system of equations is always zero.
36:06
But the more we have infinite solutions like in this case, when?
36:11
The tort law allows you to have the third column to be a free variable.
36:16
That's what makes this system. That's how you conclude that this the three key vectors x one X to an X three are linearly.
36:23
Depending. OK.
36:36
So that's the exercise, actually, although you can deduce whether they are linearly in these three vectors are linearly independent or dependent,
36:42
using the old technique, you should practise using caution illumination to identify how many pivots you get.
36:53
OK. What about the targ equation? What about the second problem, which is.
37:02
Which is consisting of three vectors of each of five dimensions.
37:12
Again, when you tried to solve this, you and get a reduced role on foreign.
37:21
You will get three pivots in this case. Which means there are no free variables, which means there's a unique solution,
37:30
which means that the only solution is the zero solution, which means these three vectors are linearly independent.
37:39
OK, good. Moving on to bases now.
37:48
Basis, right? So if I have any given sector and outlets as an example, because it's easy to visualise,
38:12
we'll think of our workers in our tree, the three dimensional Euclidean space.
38:24
Consider the victor. One, two and three.
38:33
Now, span of a is defined as all linear combinations of 80.
38:42
OK. This is the set of all linear combinations of eight, which is in this case, because there's only one record.
38:49
It means all scalar multiple multiples of the vector.
38:57
Eight. OK. This is what we mean by this ban also make it correct.
39:03
And this, you can visualise, is a straight line you've just scaled back.
39:14
Victor, A. This is just a straight line which passes through the origin.
39:19
With record on it somewhere. OK.
39:35
And this, you can show, is a maker space again,
39:43
how using the definition of a makerspace space is that the if you take any two vectors on this line on this span,
39:49
their addition, we will be able vector on that line.
39:59
You take any scalar multiplication of vector on this line that scalar multiple off that vector well beyond that line.
40:03
Which means. Span of a. It was.
40:11
Which means span of a. Is a subspace?
40:24
Of. Partly in this case, we are talking in three dimensional space.
40:39
OK, let me take another vector B.
40:46
This won't be true, is not a subspace road. This won't be too true if it is not a subspace, which is a victor.
40:51
You mean spine of it. So if is not passing through the village, that span of air is not passing through the region, so it won't be a subspace.
41:04
If a line does not pass through the origin, then it won't be a subspace.
41:14
That is true, but the way we have defined the span of a it will always pass through origin because I can always choose lambda to be zero.
41:17
OK? All that is also a possibility, right?
41:27
So by definition, span of any vector will pass through the origin.
41:33
So, yeah, that's why it's final. It is a subspace.
41:41
OK, now consider another way to be.
41:47
Which may be something different, let's say. Zero zero.
41:55
Who? OK. Now, the span of now I look at the span of two vectors.
42:00
OK. I need to create more space.
42:11
So. OK, so now spun off.
42:28
Victor A and Victor B Vecteurs is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of envy, so lambda.
42:39
Lambda won a plus lambda to be such that Lambda one and lambda two are scholars.
42:51
All right. This is how this is. This happens to be a plane.
43:03
Right, the plane, which is defined by the two actors and be all right on that plane is a subspace will also be a subspace of.
43:11
Stand off A and B. Will also be a subspace.
43:24
Of R3 again. The reason is that if you take any linear combination of envy.
43:38
OK, any two victors in the SEC, they will be closed and that edition.
43:49
All right. So just basically just ensuring that.
43:54
The Victor Edition are closed and the scale of multiplication are closed.
44:01
How? All you need to show is let's take. Let there be two, because X and Y in the span of A and B.
44:06
Then X is some linear combination of envy, so I'll call that lambda.
44:24
Lambda won a slam dunk to be.
44:32
And it has to be some linear combination of envy. So that would be let's use gamma one in less gamma to be.
44:38
Then if I get the addition of the two vectors X and Y, these are two arbitrary vectors in the space, OK, then this would simply be.
44:54
Lambda on a lambda to be plus gamma one, a gamma to be.
45:07
Which is same as Lambda one plus gamma one.
45:19
A lot lambda two plus gamma to B, which is a linear combination of and b, which means that this X plus y record also remains in spinal.
45:24
And now again, this is an obvious what I'm doing is very trivial.
45:38
These these steps, but they are important.
45:42
Writing in an exam or an assignment that needs to be this mathematical rigour where you show that the two vectors are the addition of
45:45
two actors in this span is closed under the span is closed and the vector addition when you add to it goes in the span of an beat.
45:55
You get a vector, which is also in the spine up in. Similarly, scalar multiplication.
46:05
So for this reason, the span of A and B, any two vectors is a subspace in ATA.
46:11
OK. You can generalise this span of any given vectors will be a subspace in any and.
46:20
Dimensional Euclidean space of odd and OK.
46:29
All right. So what we have shown. We showed that the first we showed that the solution set.
46:35
It is a set of all records in odd and.
46:51
Such back, it X equals zero.
46:56
OK, for some Matrix eight, we showed that this is.
47:01
Object of space. This is a sub space. We also showed that any linear combination of two or any number of factors.
47:06
Or, let's say, spun off. Some vectors, x1 X2.
47:26
And. OK.
47:37
That span is also a subspace. You can also show that.
47:42
That a solution space of a system of linear equations.
48:01
Is the span of some bases make those all right?
48:06
OK. So basically, the only thing that I have not shown is that.
48:13
If you are giving any sub space. Can you show that it has to be a span of some bases like those,
48:22
or it has to be solution set of some system only inadequacies that this reverse implication is yet to be shown?
48:30
But that's the that's the beauty of that's that's one of the fundamental terms in the strategy that all these concepts are the same.
48:40
A solution of a system of linear equations. A subspace of our vector space.
48:54
And a span of any. And number of it, all these three common concepts, odd one in the scene.
49:03
I think we can end there. I think it's a good point to stop.
49:14
You can practise, you can think about it, visualise it and develop a feel for it.
49:18
And I, I see you next time. OK. Thank you.
49:25
Bye bye. Thanks.
