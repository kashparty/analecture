I'm going to finish this section on complexity by looking at some further examples of empathy can be problems.
0:01
And we're going to look at two, namely the metric travelling salesman problem, MDT Aspey and the vehicle rooting problem with capacities, V.R., P.C.
0:08
The metric. Travelling salesman problem is the travelling salesman problem restricted into graphs which satisfy the so-called triangle inequality,
0:20
which is a work property of metric spaces.
0:31
Let's have a diagram for that. So we've got X, Y and Z then.
0:36
We'd like to know that the distance from X to Z here is less than or equal to the distance going from X to Y and then from Y to Z like that.
0:51
And you can see that that would be true in Euclidean space if these distances were just as the crow flies, for instance.
1:03
But that's a very natural condition for us to have in the travelling salesman problem,
1:12
because if it does not hold, then we would choose to travel from X to Z via Y rather than directly.
1:16
Why would we make this journey rather than going around via a Y instead?
1:23
And obviously we can convert that into a decision problem in the same way as we did for the travelling salesman.
1:30
And we'd like to show that the decision version is ENPI complete.
1:39
Well, the first part is to verify that it's in ENPI so we can define a protocol to verify Metrick travelling salesman.
1:45
And this one just cheques whether T is a travelling salesman tour of G, we with weight less than or equal to our budget.
1:54
B And that can obviously be checked easily in polynomial time.
2:03
Arguably, there might be a further cheque we have to do, which is that the weight function here actually does satisfy the triangular inequality.
2:08
But if we do need to cheque that,
2:17
then that can obviously also be checked in polynomial time perfectly easily just by going through all pairs or triples of X, Y and Z as well.
2:20
So the more interesting issue is that we need a known NDP complete problem D Brime such that D prime reduces to the metric travelling salesman.
2:32
Well, which ones do we know? Well, obvious one.
2:43
We already know that travelling salesmen itself is and B complete.
2:48
So why not try BAC reduction?
2:52
Well, it's a bit difficult because the metric driving salesmen, if you think about it, is a special case of travelling salesman.
2:56
So what have we got to do here? We've got to take an arbitrary travelling salesman, graph GW and convert it to a new graph.
3:04
G. W prime. Possibly a I suppose G could be changed as well.
3:12
Test aside, the triangle inequality. So it's not clear how to do that.
3:18
And even if we could do that. And no doubt we could in various ways. Then that would not necessarily ensure that we get the reduction property.
3:23
This if and only if statement to the bottom of the slide here, which says that we have a yes for travelling salesman.
3:32
If and only if we have a yes for metric. Travelling salesman on the new graph that we have constructed.
3:41
OK. So let's try a different tack instead.
3:49
Why not try another reduction from we've look, we've got our reduction from Hamiltonian path to travelling salesman.
3:53
Why not see whether we can convert that on into a reduction from Hamiltonian path to metric?
4:00
Travelling salesman. Well, let's recall how R reduction is defined.
4:06
If X Y is an arc of a G this unweighted graph, then we leave it in for G prime.
4:13
The weighted graph and we give it a weight of one to encourage using that.
4:22
OK, if x Y is not an arc of G, then we added in because we need a complete graph and we give it a high weight off to to discourage it being used.
4:27
Well, then, if you think about it,
4:40
our new graph actually does satisfy the triangle inequality because we have this property that for any any wait is between one and two.
4:42
So the they've met the minimum wage on the right hand side here is going to be one plus one, which is two.
4:54
And so therefore and the the highest wait on the left hand side is two.
5:02
And so we always have the triangle inequality. So we actually did a stronger thing.
5:06
We actually constructed an instance of metric travelling salesman when we were reducing Hamiltonian path to travelling salesman.
5:12
And we can conclude from that that Hamiltonian path does indeed reduce to the metric.
5:19
Travelling salesman.
