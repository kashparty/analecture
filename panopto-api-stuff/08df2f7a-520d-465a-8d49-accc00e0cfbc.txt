Title: Arctic Lake ACI Talk Feb 21
Category: AY20/21
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 11/02/2021
So welcome, everybody, to today's application of computing, an industry seminar.
0:02
We're delighted to have Nicholas Coalson articulate. Technology.
0:07
He's going to tell us about a very interesting low latency risk engine for trading.
0:11
All right. Quite a serious topic. I think the one I'm really looking forward to learning about.
0:17
Sir Nicholas, please take it away. All right. Thank you. Well, hello, everyone.
0:24
My name is Nicholas and I'm one of the co-founders of Multiplexed Technology.
0:29
I'm very happy to do this talk and interact with talented future professionals while presenting how we use technology to solve business problems.
0:35
At Articling. Their brief introduction about us.
0:44
I would provide some context on the finance industry and its move towards algorithmic trading.
0:50
I will dress then focus on one solution we are offering and explain what it takes to build an ideal risk engine.
0:56
What are the challenges to get there? The journey so far and the experience our clients have.
1:04
Why working with us? And finally, I will talk about the start of world and be totally biased.
1:09
Why? Explaining why you can use such a great place to start a career.
1:17
Artic Lake is a fintech company providing technology services to financial institutions.
1:23
Our clients are mainly Tier one financial institutions, whether banks, brokers or funds.
1:29
But we also work with other fintech start-ups. Paul, his clients.
1:34
Our mission is to empower them to interact quickly and efficiently with this
1:39
financial market in order to ultimately improve the productivity and profitability.
1:44
Right now, we are a team of eight employees with backgrounds in computing,
1:50
mathematical finance, hedge funds, physics, and that a science that we're rapidly growing.
1:54
It took us many years to get there, first of all, because we're disrupting the challenging space,
1:59
but also because we made strong decisions to ensure sustainable growth.
2:05
With fully self-funded so we can think long term about our strategy and avoid any short term pressure from investors.
2:10
Because a lot of start-ups authoring investor money have problems without knowing if their business model is profitable, if the market is big enough.
2:17
And if there's a product marketing, we've confirmed all that.
2:24
And we also have a very strong processes along the way.
2:28
Now we're approaching the scale up stage and we're hoping to double the size of our team within the next year.
2:31
Before I die a bit more into our space. Let me remind you a few facts about the finance industry.
2:39
So essentially, financial markets allow the flow of money, we are investments or other financial instruments.
2:45
Between and within corporate finance, personal finance and public finance.
2:53
Namely that businesses, individuals and states. And intermediaries exist to facilitate financial transactions between diverse parties.
2:59
An exchange is a central intermediary acting as a marketplace where financial instruments are traded at prices different,
3:09
driven by the law of supply and demand.
3:17
You can trade shares in companies in commodities, whether it's like metals, agriculture, agricultural products or even like energy, like oring gas.
3:21
Transactions used to happen on open outcry trading floors.
3:32
Bidlack like the wolf of Wall Street. But it has gradually moved towards electronic trading, where computer technology brings.
3:36
Buyers and sellers together over a network.
3:43
The industry is heavily regulated to try and minimise this like systemic, systemic risk that is spilling over the real economy,
3:47
as we've sadly observed during the financial crisis and its aftermath in 2008 and after.
3:55
We call our solution Alyx, which stands for Arctic Lake Executions.
4:04
It's an investor job to have a view on the market and allocate capital with the expectation of a future financial return or to gain an advantage.
4:11
She would buy if she believes the price will go up and she would sell it, she's hoping for the price to go down.
4:20
For example, if you think Tesla is going to disrupt the automotive industry, you expect their earnings to grow from one year to the next.
4:27
And you should buy now to lock profits at the company. Valuation increases.
4:35
So the first step is always an investment decision. But then this decision must be executed.
4:40
And execution refers to feeling it by also there in the market, subject to conditions placed on the order by the client.
4:46
They will ask, for example, for a certain size or limit price. And with lex, we handle exaction in a fully automated fashion.
4:57
And it's quite a complex.
5:06
It's a very complex algorithmic problem because all the brokers are required by law to find the best possible means to execute a couple time three.
5:08
Ilex, so is our proprietary electric trading platform focussing on execution and order flow management?
5:19
The solution is composed of ultra low latency, ultra low latency technology co-located with the exchanges.
5:28
Because speed is key in our space.
5:36
So we ran like super optimise code on powerful machines running in the same data centres that the exchange servers to minimise network latency.
5:39
The core platform is supplemented by cloud services to feed out data driven models and produce compliance and analytics reports.
5:49
We're big users of open source technologies, and we make sure it's down towards the state of the art technology to keep an edge over the industry.
5:57
And yeah, I would say that, like, yeah, we're really happy and proud of how design that I believe is like future proof was very low technical, Daniel.
6:05
Our solution is operated as a service on behalf of our clients.
6:16
When sure like department at scale of year develops technologies to set up our servers, configure networking and manage our communities clusters.
6:22
We provide ongoing support. We are constantly monitoring our system.
6:32
And we build reports to assess performance and guide business decisions.
6:36
Furthermore, we've been in this industry for a long time and we've gotten many inside of a decades of interactions with people in the industry,
6:41
and we like to share this expertise with our clients to give objective feedback and obtain differentiated solutions.
6:48
lex can be used for many applications. I mean,
6:57
we've designed exaction algorithms that are pleading large orders into smaller ones to minimise the average exaction price of a given trading window.
7:00
We remember we've implemented smart order routeing logic to guarantee best execution between multiple trading venues.
7:09
We have solutions to help, hence market liquidity and thus reduce the cost to convert financial assets back into cash would be a complete risk engine.
7:16
And we've even been involved in the cryptocurrency space. There's a lot of things to talk about.
7:28
But in this present, in this talk, we're going to zoom on our resolution to highlight how we operate,
7:33
interact with our clients and solve business problems with technology. But let's first define what is meant by financial risk.
7:40
Simply put, financial risk is the possibility of losing money on an investment or business venture.
7:49
Are different types of risk. The credit risk is the danger, associating with borrowing money.
7:58
If the borrower becomes unable to repay the loan, he will default and you will never see your money again.
8:05
So you want to avoid that? Then you have also the market risk that is linked to the uncertainty about the fair value of financial assets.
8:11
Let's say, for example, you bought one Bitcoin last year at the same period, which was roughly around ten thousand dollars.
8:20
I mean, you most likely started to cry when the price went down to five thousand dollars and when the pandemic kicked in.
8:28
But now you're kind of like laughing because it's worth more than forty five thousand dollars.
8:35
So the price has evolved a lot over the last year. And this volatility in price is what is called the market risk.
8:40
You can also have, like, liquidity, risky, like if you're in deep need to buy or sell an instrument.
8:48
But no one on the other side wants to offer a good price. And also, I can mention the idea of personal risk.
8:53
And there could be many, many things. But one example that I find quite illustrative is what is called the fat finger error,
9:00
which happens when there's a keyboard input error, a mouse bisquick.
9:07
Let's say, for example, you're supposed to buy one million shares of Google and instead you take 10 millions.
9:11
Well, your position is definitely not the same. Kind of like risk exposure.
9:17
If it happens. So risk assessment is a must for any financial institution as it encourages more informed decisions.
9:22
It drives hedging where you strategically use instruments to offset the chance of any adverse price movements.
9:32
And it will push for diversification to avoid putting all your eggs in the same basket.
9:41
So what's an ideal risk engine? First of all, the engine should operate like freetrade as opposed to put straight.
9:49
This is because we want to have an accurate assessment of the risk.
9:57
Another contributes to the portfolio before deciding whether the order should be allowed or rejected.
10:01
As we've seen, there are different patch of threes. Some are based, such as the fat finger error.
10:08
Some are model based. Rules are generally fast and don't need to be computations.
10:15
They were set up by market authorities as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and all financial institutions have to enforce them.
10:21
Otherwise they cannot access the market anymore.
10:30
Model based risk cheques can require heavy calculations, matrix multiplications, machine learning or statistical simulation.
10:35
They are much harder to get in pre trade. And yet they are the best representation of the risk.
10:44
In the high frequency trading space where large, very large number of orders are transacted, infection's of a second speed is key.
10:53
And everyone is fighting for these extra Microsoft microsecond advantage.
11:02
At Artic Lake, we aim to perform a complete risk calculation, said Microsecond.
11:08
And speed is so important because the faster you receive up to date market data, the faster you can react to the price information.
11:14
And the faster you can interact with the actions,
11:23
the quicker you can place a man or withdraw an order and thus implying that you increase the chance of getting executed at a better price.
11:24
And look, profits. We also need a distributed setup to ensure a global view across the multiple lex instances co-located with the exchanges.
11:34
People are trading all over the world and risk is taken at the same time on multiple trading desks in the US, in Europe and in Asia.
11:45
So we need to make sure that individual risk never exceeds the risk limits of the institution
11:54
without going through a central risk engine and without being overly conservative.
12:00
Within these constraints, the risk assessment must remain accurate.
12:07
If you overestimate the risk, you have less capital to allocate on the investment.
12:11
But if you underestimate it, there's a chance of a big financial loss. If the market goes against you.
12:15
Ideally, you should build a risk model that is generic enough to accommodate any asset costs.
12:23
There are many types of financial instruments, whether it's like equities,
12:30
commodities, bonds, effects, derivatives, and they all have their own dynamics.
12:33
And these calls for data driven models of a rule based system,
12:40
that the model must also be explainable because our clients need to justify it when others are rejected.
12:45
And they must present guarantees about the risk framework they're proposing to their own clients.
12:53
People want to have access to all investment opportunities and trading in all the major exchanges in the world.
12:59
So that's what we need is for market coverage.
13:08
Also, the risk engine must be easily reconfigurable to ease cranham boarding and provide the flexibility to define customer relationships.
13:12
For example, you may have more conservative margins when you're working with a new client.
13:21
Or you can be less strict, restrictive with someone who has like like very solid financial statements.
13:25
And the last point is quite important as well, because we want to make it easy for banks to connect to lex.
13:32
Because you have, like way more bureaucracy in banks. So they are telling me that very often slow to make decisions.
13:39
I look at resources and implement specifications that we want to limit.
13:47
The amount of work for them to the meaning of all these constraints are super difficult to get right.
13:52
Aiming for the sub microsecond latency is extremely hard. We have to use a balance of sugo optimised code and High-Performance Hardware.
14:02
And while we know how to calculate risk exactly. We need to also make, like very quick decisions.
14:10
That doesn't that don't compromise accuracy and especially in a distributed setup.
14:18
And for that, we need sophisticated protocols, algorithms and analogies to manage risk across geographically distributed is controlled.
14:24
We also have to deal with all the big data's challenges, are we running on terabytes of data to calibrate our models?
14:34
And we're dealing with a very big space with many asset classes and extensive protocols to support at the moment.
14:40
I believe there's no commercial pilot addressing all these concerns, but we are, well, advancing our journey to fill that gap.
14:47
This journey, the risk journey, started in 2015.
14:57
We nurtured a relationship with a brokerage firm that was pressed to find a fast freetrade solution to cope with new postcrisis risk constrained.
15:02
It started with a proof of concept to implement the models created by the risk team.
15:11
And we use Python to replicate the logic and ensure alignment. The executable specification.
15:16
Then we implemented the models in Java and benchmark our code to demonstrate performance to low latency members.
15:23
The solution was deployed to production roughly like five years ago.
15:32
And over the years, new requirements emerged, we had to support new geographical region and work with multiple Eric sites.
15:37
We extended models to accommodate new rules and security glasses,
15:45
and all these new requirements led to increased algorithmic and implementation complexity, which triggered a complete rewrite of the solution.
15:50
Powered by all the insight we completed over the years. Also, the rule based system was a good way to get us started.
15:58
We realised early on the need for generalisation and we accelerated our R&D to
16:06
have our own data driven model to accurately cheque risk with ultra low latency.
16:11
Of course, we still have black margin for improvement.
16:17
We we expect to keep tweaking the Jedi and play with Sibiu instruction and move some of the crew to dedicated High-Performance Hardware.
16:20
And we also intend to use machine learning to make our models even more accurate.
16:29
Are data driven model is based on a measured risk measure called the expected chockful and the
16:36
expected chockful is the expected return on the portfolio for the worst percent of outcomes.
16:42
Let's say you have a poll for your positions in multiple financial instruments. Depending on where the market goes.
16:49
This portfolio. This portfolio can generate profit on us.
16:56
Portfolio can be well diversified or oil assets might be highly correlated, leading to a big exposure to an adverse price movements.
17:00
The whole exercise is to accurately estimate the distribution of profit and loss in order to come
17:10
up with a single number stating how much you expect to lose four X percent of the worst cases.
17:17
The risk engine is the Constitution, but it comes with many other services.
17:30
We mentioned the executive specification and we use them to get an alignment with expected business requirements and also to act as documentation.
17:35
But we also run them as part of our continuous integration pipeline to guarantee no regression as we evolve the technology.
17:43
We are parad many exchanges and sites.
17:51
So there's a need for continuous monitoring and alerting as we strive to be aware of production issues before our clients even notice it.
17:53
We also provide a dashboard for our clients to have a real time understanding of the state of the risk engine.
18:02
And we produced like multiple reports to demonstrate our low latency numbers and assess performance.
18:09
We are big believers in enabling our clients.
18:16
We are. Stand at Rest and WebSocket API. And they use it to integrate with their own boats and test the system or perform model practise.
18:20
And finally, I would say that we're very proud to have a very reactive support with type service level agreements.
18:31
I might be a bit biased here, but I believe that it's an amazing experience to work at a Start-Up.
18:44
At a small tech start-up, everyone has to wear different hats that everything gets done.
18:51
You'll be exposed to more technology. You'll get direct exposure to clients and learn about the business as a whole.
18:58
You will often get the chance to interact directly with the co-founders and work closely with senior employees with years of experience.
19:04
I believe that after two years at a Start-Up, you will be miles ahead of your cohort.
19:12
You will have levelled up your skills and gain confidence. And this will give you a message, a massive hedge in your career.
19:16
You'll get to collaborate closely with colleagues in an environment where your ideas matter and where you're given like responsibilities.
19:24
You'll see your ideas and your work in action weeks into the job rather than years.
19:32
And you could be a part of something that disrupt an industry. With bigger terms comes bureaucracy and meetings, lots of meetings at a start up.
19:36
Decisions are made quickly and you will learn powerful habits to create and cheap products efficiently.
19:50
At Artic Lake, we are able to collect immediate feedback from our clients and from the market and incorporate this feedback into our business.
19:57
We do not have to get sign up from eight different departments when have a good idea.
20:04
We ran with it. And also Constance's is often easier within a small team.
20:09
I personally love start-ups. I'm happy to be a meaningful part of something exciting,
20:17
but it is critical to ask the right questions and do your due diligence when you're choosing your Start-Up.
20:22
I mean, I've talk about it,
20:29
there's a lot of start-ups that throw investor money at problems and they haven't like make sure they've reached like product markets.
20:30
Also, start-ups are generally measures than they're well established companies, especially when it comes to embodying new team members.
20:38
So make sure that your Start-Up is adequately prepared to help you succeed.
20:46
Ask about the code base and the software development practises to make sure you can handle the mess.
20:51
Finally, make sure that you respect the founders and senior employees,
20:56
because sometimes founders are very young and it's a good idea to make sure that there are more than just visionary with a talent for pitching values.
21:00
Do they understand the technology they're trying to build? They really have the assets they have.
21:08
They say they have. Finally, I would say that, like, start ups are not for everyone.
21:12
There is less formal training. So working in a start-up requires drive, curiosity and a willingness to earn.
21:18
start-ups are generally fast paced and your responsibility will go quickly, and if I have to summarise.
21:25
That's my view, obviously. But the pain at a big corporate will be frustration with bureaucracy, boredom,
21:32
lack of personal growth, monetary entry and dissatisfaction that your ideas fall on deaf.
21:38
Here's. The pain at the Start-Up will be how to work in accountability.
21:44
So what about working at Articling? Well, I believe we provide an amazing environment for you to grow as skilled professionals.
21:51
You'll get the chance to interact directly with the co-founders.
22:01
You can expect a period of intense mentorship for the first two months to help you ramp up the skills you need to thrive at your role.
22:05
We heavily will rely on carrier viewing to maintain a high quality standard and sure,
22:14
coordination and alignment between multiple parts of the system, as well as teach and share best practises.
22:19
To collaborate a lot. Within the team, we're also striving to make every member of the team accountable for their own project.
22:26
So by the end of your first three months on the job and even before you will be making
22:31
a real contribution to the team and you will get to see your work using your life. I personally find that extremely rewarding.
22:36
We've invested heavily in our processes to make sure everyone can work productively towards the same goal.
22:44
Our continuous integration pipeline makes sure that we can ship regularly and safely,
22:50
and we are forcing strong security practises throughout our infrastructure to prevent an intentional mistakes.
22:54
The strong focus on that process is materialising itself by the grant of the ISO twenty seven,
23:02
a one label that is an international standard on how to manage information security reliably in terms of confession,
23:06
confidentiality, integrity and availability. Got it last year.
23:15
And it was quite the achievement for a company of our size because, Jerry, this is typically an enterprise effort.
23:20
So I feel it definitely shows our ambition and it's an integral part of our strategy
23:28
as it provides a lot of guarantees to the financial institutions we're working with.
23:32
We've talked about the risk engine, but we have many more interesting projects you could be involved in.
23:37
Hardcore low latency optimisation is that you could be designing new trading algorithm,
23:44
using dev ops to deploy our solutions or improve our processes.
23:50
You could perform data, set analysis over terabytes of data, create new models, improve existing or existing ones,
23:54
extend the UI and produce more reports that will be that will allow us to showcase the impact performance of our solution.
24:01
And also, we were strong on innovation because we we really want to make sure that we always keep an edge on the industry.
24:12
And finally, I would say that, like,
24:23
we're entering an exciting new phase of growth and I believe it's a perfect time to join and help us disrupt the industry.
24:25
After all, this should not come as a surprise that we are hiring. So feel free to drop us an e-mail at Carious at Articling become.
24:36
I hope I've managed to peak your curiosity and I will leave you with one final advice for your career, because you are at the very beginning of it.
24:45
And I would say that you should aim to maximise your opportunity for learning over anything else,
24:54
because all these skills you will acquire early on will compound in the future and give you a massive edge in the rest of your career.
25:00
Thank you for having me. I'm happy to reply to any questions you might have.
25:08
That's absolutely brilliant. Thank you very much, Nicholas. Does anybody have questions?
25:14
Maybe I can kick off a while, people think of what they might like to ask.
25:24
So you mentioned that you've been looking at trading in the cryptocurrency space, which is rather interesting, and you want it.
25:29
Could you please tell us something about how that differs to conventional equity markets?
25:39
Yeah, we actually work in the cryptocurrency space like a few years ago, so it was.
25:46
Much year than it is now, because back then they were not so many exchanges, nothing so many like market data feeds and.
25:51
It was like kind of like fringe investment at the time.
26:01
It is very different because. There's no, like, kind of a clearing system about it.
26:07
There's like. A lot of fragmentation in the market. By then, like loads of people were starting to open exchanges and the cryptocurrency space.
26:16
And there's no, like, central regulation around it.
26:26
So that creates new challenges around it.
26:31
We've so we've helped like a start up as well in the cryptocurrency space.
26:36
And since then, like, they they've moved to something a bit different. They've done some more like consultancy, because I believe timing wise,
26:44
they were a little bit too ahead of the curve and institutions were not ready to invest massively in crypto currencies.
26:52
Right now,
27:03
they actually like getting back into that space because there's like way more struction in the in the institutional space for crypto currencies.
27:03
And I believe will resume working with them. Maybe within the next year.
27:14
Great. Great. I mean, this is a very, very hard industry to be in, right?
27:19
Because you've got very, very stringent correct requirements.
27:23
You've got stringent performance requirements. You have stringent data quality requirements.
27:27
If any of those things goes wrong, it can end up potentially costing you millions or billions.
27:32
Right. So, I mean, how do you how.
27:40
And if the regulations change, you then need to potentially go back and look at your compliance across all of those different aspects all over again.
27:46
Right. So this is a how do you cope with that sort of intense pressure, if you like?
27:55
Yeah, that's that's very true. I believe on.
28:02
It's a combination of multiple things. First of all, the fact that, like we're in this business for a very, very long time.
28:09
And yeah, this requires a lot of experience because, as you say, you need to stay on top of a lot of things.
28:18
And we've also dedicated a lot of time on working on the design.
28:25
Because. Yeah. Like, it makes a very, very big difference.
28:33
And you also want to have something that is evolvable, like I give you like a one example that shows like how it's important for us.
28:38
The company has been existing, like for at least 15 to 20 years.
28:49
And like we started back to work with AirLand, which is an unusual family, which is programming language,
28:54
but it's a programming language that has been designed by Ericsson for telecommunication purposes.
29:01
And it's something that is is very, very, very well with asynchronous problem.
29:08
And we realised that it was hard to maintain an.
29:13
And there were not so many people actually lack specialist in that language,
29:19
and that was a problem for us to evolve in and keep an eye out to make sure we can attract talent and so on.
29:23
So we've decided I think it was like eight years ago, to completely rewrite a whole platform on Java based on Java.
29:29
So we need a first like a due diligence to make sure we could match the low latency requirements we needed to to to to to expose, to show.
29:39
And and then. Yeah, then like, we kind of like free rewrite the whole problem, like.
29:49
Java, that is way easier to maintain. So we took all these insights from the previous platform that was a complete working platform and
29:56
made sure we get the best practises and that journalise are designed to accommodate that many,
30:06
many more problems. So I think this one very important and just stuff that is like I feel like extreme importance,
30:13
like we've invested massively into the dev ops movement.
30:21
We make sure that it's simple because like, you know, like it.
30:26
I find it like very interesting the the world of Start-Up.
30:31
But when it comes to investment, when you get like a lot of investors behind, you can be really good because it can accelerate your growth.
30:36
But there's also a danger because there's there's a benefit of being like resource constrained format.
30:43
And we've been resource constrained for a long time because we are self-funded. So we we've.
30:49
We we have to kind of stay the small team for some time,
30:54
but it would drive us to create like really strong processes and to use technology to deploy our solution at scale to monetary at scale.
30:59
And embracing this Debix movement has been extremely instrumental for us to address all the requirements in terms of liability,
31:09
integrity, safety and so on. Yeah.
31:20
I mean, I find your choice of Java quite interesting because usually these sort of platforms would be done in, say, C++.
31:24
And we've had talks from other companies where they've said they've tried this sort of thing in Java and then they've run into trouble with,
31:30
for example, stop the world garbage collection kicking in in the middle of a vital procedure.
31:37
And then and then the latency going out the window.
31:43
Have you have you had trouble or you have to tweak the job of virtual machine a lot to deal with that kind of issue?
31:46
Yeah, that's that's that's a very interesting remark. And it's definitely that.
31:52
How it started, like we started, like when we did this full rewrite in Java,
31:58
that's the first thing we we we started to to address, like make sure that we can reach.
32:02
Performance on par with the C++. The thing is like your toy, right?
32:09
Like these like garbage collection events can be a total killer to latency and it's a no go.
32:13
So what we do is that we have like very, very strong rules in the sense that we never create objects.
32:20
So it never gets garbage collected. And also we tweak the JVM.
32:27
We make sure that that we configure it like in the most optimised way.
32:36
We have a benchmark's to a. Search through the greater.
32:40
But also like I think I like the GTM as made like a lot of progress in itself.
32:47
And it's it smart is able to kind of like optimise things by itself.
32:53
So we benefit in some way from the injuring of the JILIAN to optimise a lot of things.
32:57
So we do have like some form of constraints within our codes.
33:03
So we have like one part of our code that is the core that is extremely low latency.
33:07
And in that path we abide by like very strict rules when it comes to writing the code.
33:12
And above all, never create objects because as you said, we don't want those stop the world events.
33:19
That would be a massive problem for latency and with massive business implications if the decision is not made fast enough.
33:27
Right. Other people must have questions. Anybody just either type in the chatter or just talk or put your hand up.
33:39
Yeah. Can I ask about the risk model, do you use the same models for, like, all your customers and have the kind of carry that responsibility,
33:49
or do you take it from the customers and you kind of implement an optimised version?
33:58
And how how does it work for cryptocurrency as well? Because the the fluctuations are so big in those markets.
34:03
So. One of the the key thing that we want for this year is going to is do to to be configurable.
34:12
And you're right that like some clients don't have the same kind of like focus on the is some somewhat be more focus on their credit risk,
34:21
some on the market risk. Some are like the most obliged by law to abide by some rules, like I mentioned, the fat finger.
34:29
But there's that many other rules that have been established by market authorities and.
34:39
Well, we want you out. It is like an environment where we bought a new client.
34:45
Agree with him. What are the rules we need to enforce? And then, like, make sure to easily configure the rules for this crime.
34:49
When it comes to the models. We aim with this expected show, a model to other verdure models that we can use for all our clients.
35:00
But what will happen is that some clients will trade in some exchanges, some in others.
35:09
And the dynamic is somewhat different in the different exchanges.
35:16
And that's where that's when we need to exploit the data to market data to calibrate the models.
35:19
So the model will generally be the same. The calibration will be different from one client to the next.
35:25
As for the cryptocurrency, I have to say that like we haven't we haven't dealt with risk in that space because, yes, it's true that it's a.
35:32
It's a message that you won. I mean, we don't work with this crap to cryptocurrency Start-Up at the moment, that.
35:44
If we do, we will definitely try to use that model and calibrated against those markets as well.
35:53
OK. Thank you. Very good.
35:59
Anybody else, I'm not a question. Maybe why people think I ask another one, so monitoring a lot of differing servers and systems for,
36:04
you know, performance issues that are happening on the microsecond scale.
36:28
Must be a huge challenge. So, I mean, what does what does that kind of monitoring look like?
36:32
Yes, it is, definitely. So we have like the way we look at it, whether to pass.
36:40
Uh, mostly we have. A pipeline that is like based on logs.
36:48
So we love a lot of things in.
36:57
In lex and even in like all of our systems, we collect all these logs and we we ship we ship them to a Arctic search cluster.
37:01
And on top of this logs, when we're on top of gathering this house,
37:11
then we write alerts and we monitor basically specific events or the rate of events,
37:16
things to be able to tell us when some like unexpected error occurs or when there's like,
37:23
I don't know, like sudden misbehaviour that floods the system with a lot of logs.
37:33
So we have a lot of alerts on that part. And also we have another pass.
37:39
So that's the logs pass. But then we have another pass, which is Bolac Metric Space, and we instrument our code, our code.
37:42
And also like the the different pieces of technology.
37:50
Now, infrastructure is instrumented as well.
37:55
And we use Prometheus to collect all those metrics and alert us when they start behaving inappropriately, improperly.
37:58
Very good. Perfect. Right. So does anybody else have a question? I have a question.
38:11
You mentioned software defined networks. Is that something you kind of write yourselves and then deploy maybe to the cloud?
38:17
Or do you use, like a managed service provider for that? So we use.
38:26
So I actually I'm I'm less familiar with the network, but we use.
38:31
Other aperitifs, STEM is provided by consistent use, that word that allows us to fully.
38:37
Fully configure the network, stock the networks that where we make sure to, first of all,
38:45
link all the different parties, whether it's our clients, our platforms, the exchanges and so on.
38:54
And, of course, like there's a lot of complexities around it because we have lax, strict security requirements.
39:00
So it's always like VPN is involved side to side connexions to make sure that gear like daytimes encrypted in fly and at rest.
39:07
So then we use the technology drop's technology called US stock to configure those servers and network stacks digital.
39:20
Very good. Anybody else? Good question. If not, maybe Nickless.
39:37
Is there a way for the students to contact you and what kind of opportunities are there for students to work with you?
39:51
Yes, sure. I mean, I would be, like, delighted today if we if we start getting, like, our e-mails to carry us out to take the come.
39:58
And even if it's just questions all you want, like more precision.
40:07
First of all, I would encourage you to go look at the website.
40:12
And and then, yeah, if you have any questions that don't hesitate to send in, you know, I'm curious that adults get there, come.
40:15
And then we will obviously look at it and and we play.
40:24
Yeah, that's brilliant. All right. Is this your last chance to ask a question?
40:33
No. OK, well, then, thank you very, very much, Nicholas.
40:46
That was brilliant. And a unique insight into the trading industry.
40:50
I hope you get lots of good feedback and contact for context from students.
40:58
Thank you very much for your presentation. Well, thank you for having me.
41:04
And I'm looking forward to receiving your application. And I'm wishing you all the best in your careers wherever you started.
