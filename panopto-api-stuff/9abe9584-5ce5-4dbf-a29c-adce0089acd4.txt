Title: L07 - Time-Dependent behaviour of digital circuits with feedback (part 2)
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova
Date: 27/10/2021
All right, so welcome, everyone, and we are now back to the second part of our seventh lecture.
0:07
And remember that we just looked at what happens when we add feedback to our logic circuits.
0:14
We saw that basically our boolean equations broke down.
0:21
But if we look more closely at the physical or electrical level, we can see that what's happening is that the signals are changing over time.
0:27
So what we can do now is go back to our initial circuit.
0:38
So now what we can see is that if we look at it using the switch and delay model, the output that we get over here from from this gate.
0:43
Is not immediate and in fact, we are going to have some input suits and after a while, boom, we will have the new.
0:54
So now we take, for example, this to be one.
1:02
For example, we assume this is also one.
1:07
The signal will travel along the wire, then the gate is going to sense one one and after a while we will have a zero.
1:10
After that. This is no longer one. It is zero. So the signal will travel along.
1:21
And after a while, what we will have here being a zero,
1:28
what's the value that we are going to have is going to be a one and then he's going to try again.
1:34
And the same is going to happen. So what we can see here is that this circuit,
1:40
thanks to this feedback and in this case using these Nannygate, it basically has an oscillating behaviour.
1:46
And that is really interesting, as we will see. So one way to understand it instead is would be using the variable resistor model.
1:55
And whenever we said eight to one, this would be equivalent to a nannygate.
2:05
And of course, then we would have in the variable resistor model, we would have an input voltage.
2:10
Then the circuit that represents, uh, an inverter, given that a one is sorry,
2:15
given that a is one on an end, the resulting logical gait would be equivalent to an inverter.
2:24
And then we have the output voltage. Now, we could use some complex formulas to calculate what happens here.
2:32
But something very simple that we can do with this model is assume that infl input voltage is the same as output voltage.
2:40
And what we would have here then is this straight line that crosses across the origin,
2:49
both axis and what we would see over time if we took multimeter into the circuit,
2:59
we would see that the the signal settles at around one point, two volts,
3:05
which does not seem that useful because that is basically the invalid state that we were trying to avoid.
3:11
Now, if we look, if we were to look much closer with a very high resolution oscilloscope working at very high frequencies,
3:19
we would we would, in fact see some variabilities over time and even more so if you used more complex circuits.
3:26
So what we are going to do for them for the rest of the course, and especially for the rest of this lecture,
3:34
is instead look at the Sweetin DeLay model, because it's close enough to give us a useful way to reason about what happens with this feedback.
3:41
So remember that with a switch and delay model,
3:51
what we have is that we sense the inputs in the gate and after a while we change the output and then recalculate again.
3:54
Given this new output, what what is the fact that it occurs in inputs and then after a while when we calculate the annual output.
4:02
So as you can see, we are basically adding time to an axis of time into the problem,
4:11
not just that the boolean values that we had originally from the equation.
4:18
So what we are going to do is to analyse this is a sign,
4:23
as we were ready doing assign names to each of the input and output wires on on each of the gates.
4:28
And then we are going to create a table,
4:36
a truth table that not only accounts for the values of the inputs and outputs, but also accounts for the time.
4:38
And the way we are going to do that is by setting two additional groups of columns.
4:45
One is going to be the truth table before we update the outputs and another is going to be which we are going to call now.
4:50
And the other set of columns is going to be what we are going to call next,
4:58
which is going to update the outputs and input values accordingly after this delay in the switch and the model.
5:03
So what we would do is exactly this in in for example, in the Landgate, in the tour circuit that we had,
5:15
we are going to have these transition tables for now with the A term and the R for the result where we are going to do all the combinations.
5:21
And then for each one of them, we are going to calculate what happens next.
5:33
So as we already saw, when a zero and zero A will stay the same,
5:37
but R is going to change to one on the on the next, let's say, cycle after the delay of the of the gate.
5:43
And the same will happen again. And we just kept doing this zero.
5:50
And one is going to keep a as a zero and then switch R to a one and so forth.
5:56
So that's what we call the transition table, which is basically the truth tables that we already know.
6:04
But with this additional dimension of time,
6:09
with the now and next set of columns and another way that we can use to represent the
6:13
same transition table is using transition diagrams that we have here on the right side.
6:19
So basically what we have is taking is a graphical depiction of this same table.
6:26
So we are going to take the state zero zero, which is this one over here.
6:32
And we see that what's going to happen next after the delay is that we are going to go to state zero one,
6:37
which is these are all over here, and then going to zero one.
6:44
Then if we look at the next state, zero one, we see that it goes to zero one again.
6:49
So it's these are over here that goes back to itself.
6:55
And this leads to a stable state.
6:59
Basically, if we start with zero zero or zero one, we are always, after some amount of time, end up being stably at zero one state.
7:02
And then we just keep on going with the rest of states.
7:12
We take the one zero, which would be the state over here.
7:16
We see that after the delay of the gate, we would go to the state one which is over here.
7:20
And once we are at one one, we would go to one zero, which is this arrow over here.
7:26
And then this will keep jumping back and forth between these two states.
7:33
So that's what we call by stable state.
7:38
And we can see it because there is this cycle over here in the transition, Deborah.
7:43
So what we can do now is make it a bit more complicated, and instead of looking at this simple circuit,
7:50
we can look at something a little bit more complex, which is these two nannygate.
7:57
So what we did here is connect them, as you can see here.
8:02
And we are remember, as I said previously, we are going to need every input and every output of every single gate in the circuit.
8:06
So we have A and B as inputs that will be established from the outside.
8:15
And then as part of the circuit, we will have the resulting state R or the resulting TERMA.
8:22
And we are also going to have these intermediate term here, which is s now write this down using boolean equations,
8:31
we will have that as is a and are all negative and that R is going to be S and B all negated.
8:39
So as you can see, this is four variables. And if we were to build the trust table, that would give us 16 states.
8:49
So what we're going to do now is build this table with that new time dimension that we talk about.
8:56
So the transition table in this case would look as follows.
9:03
Here we have the two input variables that which are, let's say, fixed from the outside.
9:09
They are not going to change across time transitions between now and next,
9:13
but us sanat are going to change given enough time with the switching delay model.
9:18
So as you can see, we just do as we said before, if A and B are zero and that's an hour and zero,
9:26
if all of them are zero, then the next stage would be zero zero one one.
9:33
If all the initial states and the now time point were zero zero zero one, then the next day would also be zero zero one one and so forth.
9:38
And what is highlighted here on the transition table is some interesting states
9:49
where you can see that the previous state is the same as the next state.
9:54
So basically, if we have this state on the system, on this circuit, you circuit, the state of the circuit is not going to change given any time.
10:00
And this is interesting because now we are going to be looking at the transition diagram.
10:14
So as before, we are going to take each one of the possible states, draw a circle for them,
10:21
and then for each transition between now and next, we are going to draw the arrows.
10:25
So as you can see, there's four groups of them which have no arrows between them, and also if you look very closely at these circles,
10:31
you will see that the first two bits, which is A and B, are the inputs that come from the outside of the circuit.
10:41
Let's say. And we have these four islands of states because there's no outros between them.
10:50
Now, if we here we have, as you see, some stable state, another stable state, another stable state over here, another here and another here.
10:59
And then here we have the bi stable state, similar to the one we saw before with the simpliciter good.
11:10
But now if we look at the pattern here, we can if we ignore this set of states over here now,
11:17
try to look more closely at what's going on on on this transition there.
11:26
I'm going to step stop just for a few seconds so you can post a video and think about what's happening and what it could mean.
11:33
OK, so let's let's try to tease out what what we can see here is that given one input in each of these islands,
11:44
in each of these groups of of states in the transition, they are given one input.
11:55
Eventually, over time, we are going to have one fixed output,
12:02
so no matter where we start on the state of the dirham is the Amber Zero Assigner will always end up being one.
12:06
And then if we look at the zero one four and B, eventually, after some time, Asnar will always be one zero.
12:16
And similarly, we can see here even we are one zero.
12:24
Eventually Asnar will stabilise, will become stable on the state zero one.
12:29
So. Basically, we have a way to put in some state.
12:36
And somehow keep a unique state that could be used to represent it and and even though we will look at it more closely in the next lecture,
12:44
this is the basic the core basic principle on building memory, using surrogates.
12:57
So as I was just saying, we have these three sets of states.
13:04
This one is less interesting for now for this discussion so we can ignore the one one input, but for these once we have these relationships.
13:09
So, as I was saying, these we are going to use it to build a memory or more specifically,
13:19
something that later on the next lecture we will learn is called Flip.
13:25
And in this case, this is a specific type of flipflop.
13:31
So this will reach the end of this lecture.
13:35
Now, we not only know how to solve our how to build the best circuits, given all the techniques that we learn,
13:38
but we now are also able to use feedback loops so that we can build circuits that change over time,
13:46
which is that the basic tenet of having memory in a digital using digital circuits to pass.
13:53
Now, if you're a curious here, you have a link that you can watch.
14:02
It's a it's a video about how CPU's are built and you will see some of the connexions to what we saw.
14:06
But it's the talks more specifically about the physical processes that are involved from the very beginning to the very end of building.
14:16
Would you might be interested in looking at also,
14:29
it has some very epic music that I'm not exactly sure if it's the right place to have it, but well, that's what the video is.
14:33
And with this where it's, as I said, the end of the lecture and I will see you on the next one by.
14:42
