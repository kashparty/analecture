Title: Senior Tutor - Introduction to Student Welfare and Support
Category: COMP 1st Year General
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 20/10/2021
if there is something that is affecting your study, for example,
0:05
if it's a mental health problem or there are some financial situations who are struggling with visa,
0:09
there are issues in accommodation halls or any personal matters or switching between various different courses, etc.
0:16
I mean, you can you can contact me.
0:26
And if you are thinking to contemplating to leave us or to transfer to another course, at that point, you would also contact me.
0:30
The imperial is very diverse.
0:43
We are a multi-ethnic community and we believe in tolerate and respect each other's views
0:47
and I mean whether they are religious or political or with regard to their identity,
0:53
we we respect each other. So if you feel that you if you feel offended, I mean by for whatever reason, just I mean, contact us and the department.
1:01
The college has well-defined procedures to actually follow such such and such requests in such cases in people also have at the college,
1:14
we have some external courses. So do have a look at this website.
1:29
And Peter Ozone's, they usually have some talks on Tuesday afternoons, but please keep checking for regular updates.
1:33
So the timing and the dates me change. The college also offers language courses, which you can find on this on this link.
1:43
There are some courses offered from humanities as well. That's another thing some of you might be interested in.
1:54
Usually they are offered during the lunch time. So none of these courses, these are external courses,
2:01
will actually come towards your first credit or the will be might be beneficial to some of you in terms of personal development.
2:09
So we will also contact you.
2:19
Probably it will be me or your personal tutor in the first instance, if you have poor attendance, for example, or that you are achieving poorly.
2:22
I mean, for you, it creates an assessment or you miss an exam, for example, you are absent or if there is a little missing coursework.
2:33
So we will get in touch with you.
2:42
We might also I mean, if he asks you to meet us, please do not feel embarrassed that I mean, it might be something which is really urgent to discuss.
2:45
And therefore, if you receive an e-mail either from any of the staff member,
2:57
particularly the senior tutor team and you are coordinators, then please do respond as quickly as you can.
3:01
And if there are any changes to your record, for example, if there is a mobile phone number that I mean, if you if you are an international student,
3:10
let's say, I mean that that mobile number needs to be updated to a new one, then it has to be done quickly.
3:22
And if there is a change in your presidential address, let's say you are in the college hall and you have moved somewhere else,
3:32
etc., then that's something that's really important for us to know.
3:38
And it's a good practise to actually work together,
3:45
but we do not encourage head to the college is trying to work in the form of construction where people
3:48
can collaborate on individual pieces of assessments in a way where it can be seen as plagiarism.
3:59
So-called plagiarism is a very serious offence and this can result in a zero mark.
4:07
And in some cases, if there is a persistent behaviour of plagiarism, then this can result in expulsion from the colleges as well.
4:12
You can see further go guidelines regarding plagiarism on the college website and also on plagiarism dot com.
4:23
And some of the things you should consider and take them seriously is to register with a GP, a GP stands for general practise.
4:33
So people I mean, in the UK are usually registered with one of the health care providers at the college.
4:45
We have Imperial College, Health Centre. So if you're living locally, then it would be probably more convenient for you to actually just sit there.
4:54
And also, I mean, there is a lot of information in the student pages with regards to finance and welfare.
5:05
So do these as well, please.
5:10
If you can turn off your mikes, please turn off the way you should have access.
5:14
You just click distract and trying to find what it should be.
5:25
At the top of the participants list, everyone who speaks up in the top.
5:32
OK? Yeah. OK, great, that's better.
5:37
So, yeah, I mean, you also have your personal tutor, that's your first point of contact.
5:46
So if there is any issue that comes up better with regards to your personal stances or your academics,
5:52
unless you do not want to discuss it with the prosecutor,
6:00
then you can come to me or you can always come to an and to Carolyn becoming your primary sort of point of contact.
6:03
This personal tutor, that's one of the resources that is available there and usually is not used to its full potential.
6:11
So if, for example, you need some career advice of what you want to reflect on your feedback, for example,
6:23
or need some signposting or whatever it is, I mean, you have exceptional international faculty available.
6:30
And I mean, you would be personally duties to two to one of them.
6:41
So by all means, contact the prosecutor. They can help you in many different ways,
6:46
but you have to meet for common misconceptions is that university is actually easier
6:50
than what you have done before at A-levels or something similar in other countries.
6:56
That's not true. Universities actually at the same level are probably much harder than that.
7:02
So you have to work hard. And the expectations and the challenge that the imperial offers is also, I mean, of a very high standard, very high level.
7:08
So you have to put a lot of work in there. And lecturers are as important as Djiboutian.
7:20
So the more sceptical students also don't leave things to the last minute.
7:26
And if there is a lecture that is happening in the classroom, then to attend that,
7:31
I'm not I don't think that we will have many lectures going on this time in the classroom.
7:37
But if there are any look at you, I have a look at your calendar,
7:44
then it's it's better to actually attend it in person and do not try to to the passing month.
7:48
You will not pass if you do not study in Dubai.
7:57
So I revise as you as you go along in the semester, at the time, etc.
8:01
So that's all success. I mean, that's one of the slides which I believe is perhaps the most important one.
8:11
And success is actually deep rooted. You have to face a lot of, I mean, failures and there will be sacrifices, disappointments, one and so on.
8:17
But if you have dedication and you work hard and on the top of everything,
8:28
if you are disciplined and you can audit your time and you can be focussed and you definitely succeed.
8:32
So thank you. And I'll stop sharing and give control to Carolyn.
8:39
Yeah, but she'll be back. OK.
8:52
Oh, yeah. Any questions, by the way? You can either like, yeah, yeah, you can, you can you can type or you can enjoy yourself and ask us a question.
8:56
There's a raised hand button as well. Yeah. So if I.
9:08
OK, in the chat, no, Lucy says there is no question anyone else?
9:19
They are very good, very bad, and sure, it will be very good.
9:27
So, yeah, these all these students have worked really hard to get to this point and to meet Imperial.
9:33
And that's that's an amazing achievement in itself.
9:42
And the these students are very pleased. I mean, in terms of, OK, where can we find the office hours of professors stuff?
9:46
So for the leaders, I think they would actually have on their schedule when they do their first lecture,
9:57
they will probably tell you what their office hours are. Students will have.
10:06
I mean, many of the old faculty members will have different office hours.
10:11
I mean, so you will have to contact them individually. But I think they will they should be able to tell you when they would be available.
10:15
Is it the school, Constantinos? And usually what happens at the first lecture that each individual will share their office hours on the slide.
10:21
And since we don't have physical office space right now,
10:31
it's usually some time that they are able to meet with you on teams or zone or when they can answer your emails,
10:34
what your expectations should be regarding answering times that an hour a day.
10:42
So they will set that expectation on their first session. Yes, yeah.
10:47
And one of the questions is that if I am, everyone has their own personal tutor, senior tutor and or if I'm everyone's senior tutor.
10:52
So the thing is, everyone will have their own personal tutor.
11:01
I mean, the point is basically to provide you pastoral engagement and support so everyone would have their own personal tutor.
11:06
I'll be acting as a coordinator or because I mean a senior tutor for all students, but both I mean, personally tutor as well as the seniors.
11:17
Usually we have the same job that is to support you through this learning journey and to point you in the right direction if you need.
11:26
So what you should do is that if there is any question I mean the general question, for example,
11:38
then you should always first ask the prosecutor and there would be prosecutor meetings as well.
11:43
One of them, the first meeting will be happening immediately after this one eight five.
11:49
Then you will have your you should have your first meeting with your personal tutor.
11:54
And these will be these meetings.
12:00
Will, I believe that you will have at least two opportunities every time to ask any questions or to meet your personal tutor.
12:02
But you can always ask for a meeting. You can send them an email and they will see even when they are available.
12:10
So, yeah. Caroline said that is coming and she just crashed, so I thought that I mean, sometimes computers can.
12:17
OK, just the answer to the question, and it's out, I'm just looking into this now.
12:28
So if you can just check your mailbox, you should have an email in one minute.
12:33
OK, how do we quantify poor achievement? So I think what you are trying to ask is with regards to your academic performance.
12:43
Well, I mean, we will look at your assessment scores.
12:54
And if you do not perform very well there, then, of course, I mean,
13:00
that's something which will be raised, which will be picked up and then someone will contact you.
13:05
But I mean, as soon as you have the outcome of your assessment, you will know that you have performed.
13:12
And yeah. So what I normally am in myself, too, is that I have got a diary from from any mainstream, I mean,
13:19
stationary outlet or maybe from a superstore, and I would write the things I have to do each day.
13:36
I may not be able to do all of these things. I mean by by night, but I will cross the ones that I have done.
13:46
I will remove the ones that doesn't need to be done and I will move the things that I haven't been able to do on the next week.
13:53
And then I keep doing this for about two weeks. And by the end of the two weeks, I mean, on one of the weekends, I will audit myself.
14:01
So I'll see how I have done the things, whether I mean, I really wanted to do have I been able to do them in the past two weeks.
14:09
And then, I mean, I can see myself back after a month or after two months or do enough to get done.
14:18
And it will help me to assess myself that I'm in bed with my potential lies and how I have been performing.
14:24
I mean, retrospectively and therefore where the here are the areas where I need to focus, that I need to improve.
14:32
And it will also help me to keep track of things so I won't lose track.
14:39
So if you since it is your day one, I mean,
14:44
then I would say that try to to make every effort to acquire the discipline to to be in control of your time and control of yourself and otherwise,
14:49
I mean, things can go wrong pretty quick.
15:05
So I that that's that's my advice. And we have seen this I mean,
15:11
over the past so many years that it is not usually the natural capability of people that actually drive them for success,
15:16
but it is the hard work and the discipline that is the most important truth.
15:24
So and you are all students of various different abilities.
15:30
You have come from very diverse places and you have got high achievers.
15:36
So, yeah, I mean, do not underestimate yourself and what you can achieve, what you are able to achieve.
15:41
And I'm sure I mean you will see.
15:49
Yeah. Yeah. You'll be happy with your performance if you have any questions.
15:55
I think at some point you will have more information on the on how the various different modules are assessed.
16:04
So once the connectors stop, you will have more information.
16:13
I mean, what is the minimum criteria for possible Donly modularity required?
16:20
50 percent is programming. For the rest, there is 40 percent. So, yeah.
16:24
OK, so, Richard, it's I think I realise there is quite a lot of information to digest and but you'll get there.
16:32
I mean, it's usually all students I mean, on day one feel a bit overwhelmed by what is I mean.
16:46
Yeah. What they are supposed to know. But I'm sure I mean, you will see more structure over the coming days and things to normalise.
16:58
But there will be I mean, an initial initial thrust where you have to put more effort in the start and then it's sort of I mean, harmonises later on.
17:09
So, yeah, I mean, the information is there.
17:22
But if something is unclear, you can always ask those who can ask you as personal tutors, you can ask us the senior tutor and will be there to help.
17:27
So don't worry about that. Oh, that's, I think.
17:35
OK, is the original level of programming ability, knowledge of systems required, or will everything be basically from scratch and lectures?
17:46
I do not know what the what the expectations would be.
17:56
Constantinos, do you know if the students need to know programming so we don't expect you to know programming at all.
18:04
We expect you to be able to learn programming by yourselves really fast while we teach you.
18:12
So what they say for university is that we help students learn how to learn.
18:19
We don't necessarily feed you the material. We show you what's available and how you can get to it.
18:28
And then you do all the hard work. So you have to learn how to learn at the university level,
18:35
which is quite different from the school level, where they just tell you read this page by tomorrow.
18:42
There's a test, for example. So here it's more like, so this is the high school language, this is the compiler.
18:48
These are some exercises you can try. Go ahead, try them, use the lab helpers, use their help, and then there's another session coming next week.
18:55
So in order to understand the session next week, you will need to understand these materials first.
19:07
So that's how it goes. So you just need to spend some time learning new things.
19:11
And then during the term, you just need to revise past things to prevent them from being forgotten because,
19:18
you know, stimming eight modules during a pandemic year can be a lot.
19:26
So you need to revise every now and then. Since the exams are in May 2022, it's easy to forget.
19:32
And so it's good to revise. It has to be safe. Yes.
19:39
OK, Hengshui, with regards to textbooks, I think you can refer to library, there'll be some books available,
19:46
but for each module they will give you a list of their reading list available.
19:53
So once you have the reading book reading list, I mean, it would be sort of a guide guide to resources.
19:59
But I think for the first year, most of the things would be available.
20:07
I mean, if you need any further information, I mean, even Google search actually would pop up quite many resources if you need to move.
20:11
You need to know more. So, OK, do you recommend digital physical notes?
20:20
That's up to you. I always make physical notes. I have this pen and paper.
20:28
I'm old fashioned. So that's what works for me.
20:32
And it's up to you. I mean, with the physical notes, you have physical memory of writing things.
20:37
And it's for me, I mean, usually takes less time as compared to digital.
20:45
You can go through these notes, but you can forget very easily as so it's up to you.
20:50
What works for you and how do you assess the programming skills?
20:54
Is there a practical example for that, Constantinos?
20:58
Is there a practical example for programming? So let me first answer a question I received in private.
21:04
So someone asked me how do we know what to revise?
21:13
And which is a good question, really depends on what you can't remember anymore.
21:17
What I usually say is, if you know something, then you don't have to worry about it.
21:24
If you don't know something, that's what you need to to focus on.
21:28
So you're the things you like, the things you remember, you don't have to worry about them.
21:32
But anything you don't remember, that's what you need to revise and you will know what that is.
21:36
When it comes to the other question, how do you assess your how do we assess your programming skills?
21:41
And there are tests during the academic year which are assessed.
21:47
They are not the same as exams, so they take place during the academic year.
21:53
There's two for high school to for a job and one for C, so five tests.
21:57
And there's also a C group project which is like coursework.
22:02
So it's six assessments in total for programming.
22:07
And in order to prepare for those assessments, we have the weekly exercises.
22:11
There's one unassessed programming exercise every week.
22:16
However, even though it's unassessed, we market and you receive this feedback and that helps you prepare for the assessed stuff.
22:20
I don't worry if you do not remember, I mean this, but there is yeah,
22:30
there is quite a lot of assessments in there are weekly exercises that you will get there.
22:37
And also, I mean, those of you who are very new to programming or have very little programming experience in the past,
22:43
programming is not like learning how to drive a car.
22:51
If you know how to drive a car, which you cannot make mistakes in programming, I mean,
22:54
that's you'll always get stuck somewhere and you'll be kicking doors and punching tables.
22:59
And that's that's that's normal. That happens.
23:06
So but the important thing is to not let go once you know what you need to you are supposed to do by the end of the week,
23:08
try your best to actually complete it and finish it.
23:17
If you can't, you can still keep working on it. But I mean, do not just derail us.
23:22
So programming is a bit frustrating in the beginning because I mean, mistakes sometimes are not very obvious to to catch.
23:28
But yeah, I mean, it's it's all about experience and practise.
23:38
The more you practise, the better you get at it.
23:43
And also to highlight that programming is the the the core module for four distinctly, it's a department of computing.
23:48
So you are expected to be good to become good programmers by the end of year one.
23:59
So you that sense is good to actually invest a lot of time in there.
24:07
And yet. I am not sure about iPads.
24:11
I have to answer this one.
24:19
We're not bribing our students in any way.
24:23
We're not handing out any free equipment. While we do offer is lots of electronic resources available to you by the library and by citizens.
24:27
So you have access to our servers and to the slot machines, my associates, physical stuff.
24:37
So, you know, you can use office space to access the labs and attend sessions from there and you can use our love machines while you're there.
24:44
And the C Group project in the summertime will hopefully be face to face.
24:53
And for that project we will give you a Raspberry Pi that you can play around with for the project.
24:59
So we do provide everything you need to complete this course.
25:05
If you don't have a laptop, for example, and you need one to work on, then you can go to the library and borrow one.
25:08
They have this facility available. If you if your laptop broke down and you have a test programming test and it's very urgent,
25:17
then you can contact them and they can give you a laptop for you to be able to take the test.
25:26
So we do also rent out equipment for emergencies.
25:32
It's not just the library. Yeah. So I hope this helps. How can we access office space again?
25:37
You will receive an email about this. OK.
25:45
So we are waiting for Caroline to join us, and I hope that she will be able to do so.
25:51
If not, I mean,
25:58
you can always contact her on the Snetterton email or the Caroline said that she has some issues with her set up and may have to work on her part,
26:00
unfortunately, but I will send out the recording if needed.
26:12
Yeah. Yeah. OK, that's good. So yeah.
26:18
Any, any further questions. How is the weather?
26:22
Raining. OK, OK, it's cloudy and it's raining, so, yeah, foggy, OK.
26:29
Not good. I started reading. Yesterday, it was an amazing rainbow.
26:40
I saw one myself as well. It was full sky, so yeah.
26:48
OK. So I am sure I mean, you will enjoy, enjoy the first week and there are a lot of societies, you might have received emails from them as well.
26:56
So try to I mean, don't don't try to.
27:13
What I would say it is better to actually have some form of interaction with your colleagues and.
27:18
How much do we have to study on average for the to do relatively well?
27:29
It really depends from person to person, but I think the academic guideline is with regards to with respect to you regardless.
27:34
So if it's for every one of that, you do I believe there is three hours of study that you have to do on the top of that.
27:43
So if there is one hour of teaching, there is three hours of of of self study.
27:51
I think something like this, I can confirm that. But it really depends on person to person.
27:56
I mean, some people might have. Yeah.
28:01
And the other question. Look, I'm looking at the chat and.
28:07
So you should be able to speak with other members of Imperial, other students,
28:17
they have that escort server that can invite you to and every new cohort creates their own and usually tell what's up.
28:25
But there's also some some groups have Facebook better than if that's still your thing.
28:34
So, yeah, feel free to reach out and find the latest links to join.
28:40
And at some point, you will also elect a year rep who can represent you all as a whole.
28:46
Yeah, so unless there are any further questions, there was one question about internship's, I think.
28:56
What we yeah, I mean, we do have a placement programme, but that's something which will come up later on if you want to do internships,
29:09
I mean, in the first year, I don't think there is anything department can actually help with it.
29:19
It's up to you. Is it is this correct, Constantinos? Regarding with suspect internships, yes, so I mentioned this briefly in my part before,
29:26
so you don't really have to worry about internships at this point. But if you want to just for fun,
29:38
we do have the career service that you can make an appointment with and they can help you prepare to apply for internships for the summer of 20 22.
29:44
Thanks. Any further questions?
29:56
OK, are there any research opportunities? I believe I can help with that as well, if you want it, yeah,
30:02
so every usually dennery of February we release the Europe opportunities, which means undergraduate research opportunities.
30:15
So it's you are OLP. And that means that lecturers and staff members who are researchers,
30:27
they offer an undergrad the opportunity to do research with them over the summer of the next year.
30:34
So I will be in January 22, advertized for the summer.
30:41
And if you're accepted, then you will have 10 weeks of paid research work on the subject of the choice of the academic.
30:47
So you can start researching as early as the end of year one if you want.
30:57
You don't have to. But you know, it's been work, so may as well. Yes.
31:02
Any other questions? Yes, first years and second years are accepted for Europe and third and fourth years usually go for placements instead.
31:09
So that's usually meant for first and second year students.
31:22
There's also something else called the students papers. And that's not just research.
31:27
It could be implementation of some sort against something that will be paid for over the summer.
31:32
Question. Do we need to be in London for Europe? Usually, yes, the academic usually wants to meet with you once a week.
31:40
You will have some time off. It's like a job. So they might give you a week off for ten days.
31:49
So it depends on the contract you sign. And usually you have to be either physically present on campus or you can work from your accommodation.
31:54
Some lectures may allow you to work remotely, but you would still need to be in the UK for this purpose.
32:06
And just to come back to the purpose of this meeting,
32:15
so I hope you realise how important it is to talk to us and you can speak with your personal tutor who you're about to meet soon.
32:18
You can speak with her far as a senior tutor. Currently, there will be an adviser.
32:27
So it's important to speak with us about anything that concerns you.
32:33
If you feel that something is preventing you from performing at your best,
32:36
then you can contact us and we'll find ways to help you by making adjustments or in any way possible.
32:41
And there's also Thomas Lancaster. You haven't met him yet, but you will meet him soon.
32:48
