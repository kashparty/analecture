All right. So. How was it any question if you have any question?
0:04
Go ahead, if not, I will talk about some of the things that I saw that were shared amongst some of the groups.
0:13
It's a totally fine not to understand the question of problem for. Yeah.
0:23
Problem for is is it's.
0:29
It's as I said in the past week, if I remember correctly, the purpose of this module is not to understand how the physics of circuits go work,
0:32
so it's totally fine if you do not understand problem four.
0:43
It's just kind of a bonus for those of you who like this type of aspects of more physical aspects of circuits.
0:47
You will see the solution in in the tutorial. What I can say is that it may look very complicated, but the solution is relatively simple.
0:58
It's it's about substituting the voltage variable z with the threshold that is established as one volt and
1:10
then just isolating variables so that then you can solve for for the two circuits you need to the solution.
1:20
It's going to be published. That won't be absolutely Puzo.
1:28
Please, please take a look up at our group's slaughterhouses part.
1:31
I have already put it on the charge. And could you please help us to justify if we did the correct thing for us?
1:36
So for the first part, we have finally nai rc five for the second.
1:44
Sorry, the audio well, is not very good.
1:55
Can you repeat? So I think for our group's result, for the first one, we have my our safe out for a second one.
1:59
We only have seven rc. So there is always a second will be faster.
2:08
And this is the correct paths to power.
2:13
So. The final answer, the second one with the hierarchy is faster.
2:17
That's correct. The numbers, I think, are not, but you will see the solution is going to be published in like half an hour.
2:22
But but the answer is yes. The hierarchical circuit is faster, even though it has more gates to go through.
2:32
But since their final days, smaller, we can fill in the capacitance, the required capacitance faster.
2:40
Yeah, OK. And that is in fact a problem that happens.
2:48
So you are not going to sit here about in future if you own feature modules on computer architecture.
2:52
You will see what is called a. Highly associative researchers.
3:03
Which is basically a hardware structure that is memory where you look for a specific value of multiple at a time.
3:14
That's a very, very common in processors like memory caches are exactly that and they are so expensive
3:23
because there's this very big find out that is very expensive to to to to build.
3:29
Because of that, your build all these many more gates to make sure that it's fast enough.
3:37
And even then, so it's very hard to get it to be fast enough.
3:44
Do you have any other question? We have about been like, let's say, seven minutes or so because I don't want to make it look for other.
3:51
Events, this says I don't get why you need to worry about all the capacitor equations.
4:09
Why not just say left circuit has higher out is lower and be done well?
4:17
The idea is when? How do you know that right?
4:27
How do you know that the higher single level phone out is slower than having these hierarchical phone to get to the same number of advocates,
4:36
and it is just an exercise so that you see what the formula say?
4:51
That's basically it. So you say you get to, let's say, Typekit the answer.
4:55
And as I said, this this module is not about the physics, this is more for fun than anything else.
5:05
This is one problem. Yeah.
5:11
Matthew, go ahead. So do we need to note the equation for the fog out?
5:15
So calculating the voltage of the noise, so all all, the exam, like in a previous year, is going to be an open book exam.
5:21
Okay. So you can have better. Exactly, it wouldn't matter.
5:34
For those of you who aren't sure what it means, open book exam means that you will have all your notes, slides, anything.
5:40
All the materials of the class with you so you can refer to them.
5:49
So that's great because it means you don't need to memorise things,
5:53
but you still need to study so that you don't need to build answers from scratch every time.
5:57
You will need to know the material so that you get to those answers quickly,
6:03
and it's going to be more about how things get together and what happens when they get together,
6:09
which is basically because otherwise it would just be copying memory,
6:13
copying what you have written on the on the slides and notes, which is not useful to anybody reading.
6:19
Any other question? OK, so there's a question, something that I heard you struggled.
6:27
Those were basically problems. Yeah. As expected, they were problems to one three.
6:41
Those are where most of the questions were centred around for a problem to.
6:46
Remember, that first thing is. In the beginning, the signals accept the inputs, what's in an intermediate stages in the circuit to see the index.
6:58
We initially do not know what their value is and you should signal their mistakes.
7:11
Like, I just don't know, this is an unknown value and that is perfectly fine.
7:16
You're need to let the inventor value for them. Your seeds are known and that is one of the things.
7:20
The previous lights. And what is happening here in in problem two in the time diagram is something that was on the slides too,
7:25
is that we are basically going to take the inputs, calculate the new output based on that.
7:34
In this case, each of the gates, which are knowns and that output is going to become effective two nanoseconds later in in time diagram.
7:41
It's it's as simple as this if you just apply this carefully step by step.
7:51
There's no more secret trade. There really is no more secret, and then you will end up seeing that.
7:58
There's a spike on eggs that is not really what we want.
8:06
That's one of those. Well, we were discussing before the tutorial that basically signals are fluctuating and we want to get rid of that.
8:11
Now for Problem three, which is basically making all the time delays a bit more complicated,
8:24
you have to bear in mind and I'm not going to give you the answers because you're going to have them available in half an hour,
8:32
but I'm going to give you some kids if you want to, if you want to keep working on it, the whole point.
8:37
The key here is that, yes, we can.
8:42
Like, let's say, start the whole circuit from scratch and try to build something that has the same state transitions,
8:45
but built in a different way so that we don't have a spike by playing with various latencies of each of the not inverter and gates.
8:55
But that's very that's quite complicated and much easier.
9:06
A much simpler way to think about it is that, OK, we cannot go back in time.
9:14
Whatever there is a delay, there is a delay and that's it. But whatever.
9:19
Two inputs of a gate have different delays.
9:24
We can make the smallest one go faster, but we can make the first, this one goes lower so that they get there.
9:28
At the same time, we can basically delay this the fastest one so that everyone is equally slow.
9:38
And I think that that. I think that could be a hint enough so that it becomes much more clear how to go about problems that if you didn't do it.
9:45
OK, so I see there's one more coming in the general. I'm going to do this and then call it the Lakers.
9:59
We are just three minutes away from the glass. You believe there are duplicate numbers in the unique numbers since before the coursework.
10:04
That is not intentional. I will look into it and draw up a message here on the general channel.
10:16
And tell you what to do about it. It is definitely not intentional.
10:29
If if there's a lot of you who have, I will check and tell you what to.
10:33
The bottom line is, it's just a couple of you.
10:38
We wouldn't just live with it if it's many of you will rerun randomisation on that column and double check that there's no rip it to numbers.
10:42
So, OK, that's both the end of this week, basically.
10:56
Remember, there's the deadline for the, of course, world number one today at seven p.m. I think it was that feel free to send it before the deadline.
11:03
And remember that the system is automatically closing at the deadline time.
11:13
Unless you ask for an extension, so have a great weekend.
11:18
I will upload the recordings and see you next time.
11:24
OK, but.
