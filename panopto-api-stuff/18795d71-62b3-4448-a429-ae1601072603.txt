So let's look at the famous problem of colouring countries on a map of the world.
0:01
So here is an example map that I have made here. It's got six countries.
0:08
You can see that country one has neighbours, two, three and six.
0:13
And you can see that two has got one, three and four, etc. And four is rather like Liechtenstein or somewhere like that.
0:19
That happens to be sort of landlocked between two other countries.
0:30
So the question is, how many colours do we need to colour that map?
0:35
Now, in this case, you can see that three are enough, as I have shown here.
0:39
And so in general, the problem is colour the map so that if two countries share a border, then they have different colours.
0:46
So if they meet just at a corner, then they can have the same colour.
0:55
And so the question is, in general, how many different colours do we need?
1:00
In this case, three. But in more complicated maps, might we need more colours?
1:06
So let's relate this to graph theory. That was a map.
1:14
It's not a graph, but we can turn it into a plane, a graph quite easily.
1:17
So what we're going to do is let each country have a node.
1:22
You can think of that as being the capital city of the country and then join up those nodes by arcs.
1:27
If the two countries are neighbouring on the map.
1:34
So in this case, one will be joined to two, three and six.
1:38
So you can see that the the arc here from the capital of one to the capital of two goes through the common border.
1:43
And so now we have turned this into a problem of colouring the nodes of a plane,
1:51
a graph in such a way that if two knows they're adjacent, then they have different colours.
1:57
And again, we can solve it here with three colours as shown.
2:03
Well, three colours is not always enough. Here is a map that needs four colours.
2:10
We've got four countries and each of those countries, neighbours, each of the other countries.
2:16
Or if we look at the dual graph, we can see that each node is adjacent to every other node.
2:22
In fact, this is just the complete graph on four nodes, namely K four.
2:28
And clearly, every country has to have a different colour.
2:34
So we need four colours. So just to sum up what we have discovered here,
2:37
we've discovered that you can turn a map into a graph by doing the dual graph, and that will always be simple and planer.
2:43
Conversely, if you have any simple planer graph, then it will be the dual graph of some map.
2:52
So I can turn a graph like this one on the top right into a map by just creating boundaries around each of the nodes to make the country.
2:59
Well, this was a problem that exercised quite a few mathematicians and indeed amateurs.
3:13
At the end of the 19th century, because it seemed that that every map could be coloured using at most four colours,
3:21
but no one could see how to prove it or more. Exactly. Lots of people could see how to prove it, but their proofs all turned out to be wrong.
3:30
So this was a famous open problem for a hundred years or so.
3:37
And and it's a very interesting problem from the point of view of computer science,
3:43
because it was one of the first mathematical theorems to be proved with the aid of computers.
3:46
So what? To prove that every map can be coloured with a most four colours.
3:54
We need to go through lots of different cases. Now, you might think there might be infinitely many cases because a map can be indefinitely large.
4:00
But Apple and Harken, with the aid of computer analysis, managed to reduce this to fourteen hundred and eighty two cases.
4:08
And obviously this was a very exciting result.
4:18
But lots of mathematicians were not that happy because the proof was sort of generated and checked by computer.
4:22
And so how could we trust this? How could it be checked?
4:31
This is not like a conventional mathematical proof that might run to sort of
4:35
40 or 50 pages and would be sort of could be checked in principle by hand.
4:39
So that was the state of play.
4:46
Then in 1994, a different computer proof came along.
4:50
So that was sort of extra evidence that the four colour theorem was true,
4:54
that I think most people didn't really doubt the original apple and how can prove and.
4:58
But again, we still have this problem that it's very long and how can we trust it?
5:04
So 2004, further progress is made by Gonn. Gillian Werner, who checked the 1994 proof using a general purpose proof assistant.
5:11
So this is just like using a sort of logic or system like other Pandoras system that you might have seen in the logic course.
5:21
So the the advantage here is that we're not having to trust the particular proof here.
5:30
The particular methods that might have been used in proving the four colour theorem, so long as we trust the general purpose proof assistant,
5:38
it has actually checked through all the thousands and thousands of lines of the proof.
5:46
And so we if we believe the proof assistant and we we think we can cheque that all we
5:52
have to do is to cheque that our proof assistant is correctly following its rules.
5:57
Then we should indeed trust the proof of the four colour there.
6:01
So let's make a definition will say that a graph is Kay colourable. If the nose of the graph can be coloured using no more than K colours,
6:08
obviously following the rule that adjacent nodes have to have different colours.
6:17
And what we've seen from the four colour theorem, as expressed for graphs, is that every simple planer graph is for colourable.
6:21
Notice that it does say planer. There wouldn't be true otherwise.
6:30
OK. So let's now look at bipartite group graphs.
6:37
We've already seen an example of a bipartite graph, namely K three three,
6:41
which is illustrated here on the left where we've got two sets of three nodes.
6:46
And there are no connexions within the blue circles, which are the two components of the bipartite graph.
6:52
But every node on the left is joined to every node on the right.
6:59
That's the complete pipe. Bipartite graph on these two sets of three nodes.
7:03
But let's define bipartite in general now. We'll say there's a graph is bipartite.
7:10
If the notes of G can be partitioned into sets X and Y in such a way that no two notes of X are joined.
7:16
So that's the blue circle here. There are no arcs within the blue circle and no two nodes are y are joint.
7:23
That's the the green circle here, the Y. And by partition here I mean that every node is in exactly one of X or Y.
7:31
So said there's no overlap and no notice. That don't belong to either of them.
7:42
And it's quite easy to see that a graph is bipartite if and only if it is to colourable.
7:47
So we've neatly linked this to our notion of culpability.
7:54
So why should that proposition be true? Well, let's suppose that the graph is bipartite.
8:00
Then what are we going to make the colours for the notes?
8:07
Well, pretty obviously we should, let's say give X no.
8:10
The Agnos in X one colour. Let's say blue and give the notes in.
8:14
Why another colour. Let's say green. And that's a valid colouring of the graph to colouring because there's just two colours.
8:18
Because if any two knows they're adjacent, they must.
8:27
One of them must be an X and one must be in Y. So that means that they do have different colours.
8:32
Conversely, let's suppose that the graph is to colourable. What are we going to make the two components for the bipartite graph?
8:38
Well, that's easy to see that the two components. Well, let's say that they are coloured blue and green.
8:46
We'll say that the blue notes can go inside X and the green notes can go inset Y.
8:53
And then we have indeed got a bipartite graph because we can see that there are no arcs within the Sirtex or within the set y.
9:00
I should point out, though, that it's not always obvious whether or not Graff is bipartite.
9:14
For instance, the cube graph we saw earlier is, in fact to colourable or equivalently bipartite.
9:21
And but we don't. Which is not obvious to see what the sets X and Y might be.
9:29
Or maybe it's reasonably obvious. But we can indeed just colour alternate nodes, different colours.
9:33
Here it is. There we are with the blue and the black. So you can see that this is a two colourable graph.
9:40
So just to be on your aware that they may not always be drawn in such a way that it's obvious what the colouring is.
