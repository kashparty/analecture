Title: DM Oct 14 Lecture Recording
Category: Discrete Mathematics
Lecturer: Steffen van Bakel
Date: 18/10/2021
Let me see if the Dems comes back with the statement, let's trust stuff is happening.
0:04
Yeah. Good. Sorry about that.
0:11
They are so the notation with the hoop and the horizontal line through that element of and the rest of it is not element of.
0:15
And as we've seen. So this is a mathematical statement that is something you can check and you
0:23
check it by a second property B or you go through the list of all the elements.
0:28
The statement is true or false. It also doesn't hold.
0:34
And as we've seen, these things are mutually exclusive. So it is either an element is intercept or it is not.
0:38
OK, so we can have we have a statement between them, and sometimes this is because of the law school, the middle,
0:46
so we don't know which one is true now, but we don't we do know that they cannot both be true because they would be a contradiction.
0:53
Yeah, so what I will assume in this is in these lectures that every state has its own equal
1:01
relation and we will see that that equality sometimes has to be defined carefully.
1:09
It's not always automatically saying, well, it's I think it's equal to itself and nothing else.
1:13
And sometimes things are equal that you can write down differently now.
1:20
So this is an important thing to have. And sometimes I will use the equality symbol for equality within a set.
1:24
And if it's necessary, I will subscript the equals sign with the name of the set.
1:31
So they've been able to talk about. Good certain basic examples are, for example, you can list the set of all the vowels.
1:36
Yeah, so that's that's a pretty straightforward defined set.
1:46
The R you can also collect any number of elements you like, any type of guy.
1:50
So in this particular case, it's numbers and characters and strings all thrown together so they don't all need to be of the same type.
1:57
Yeah, you can have infinity large sets like seven actual numbers.
2:06
And in this course we start that with zero.
2:12
It's an important thing to know to remember that for us in here.
2:16
So this is not a universally accepted definition. Depends a little bit on who you deal with.
2:20
And by the way, you will see a lot of notation that I use in this cause.
2:27
I mean, how you write down mathematics depends almost completely on which country you're from.
2:31
And so you will have different notations in your in your backpack from the education that you've had.
2:39
And you will see that they'll use another notation here. I want you to use a notation that I use here.
2:45
So don't introduce symbols that we haven't discussed because then it becomes difficult for me to understand which saying.
2:50
OK, so we use these ellipses here to indicate that this is an infinitely large set and this is more or less saying, well, it is.
2:59
And you know how this goes. So you know how this continues.
3:07
We're going to do the same thing, for example, for the for the integers. So you start with the ellipsis on the left and the flips on the right.
3:12
Yeah. So it's just a way of describing this is not a mathematical definition, of course, because an ellipsis is not a mathematical thing.
3:19
Yeah. And there are ways in defining these threads precisely.
3:28
So that you have a very, very well, workable mathematical definition where you don't want to do that in the course
3:32
because it is a little bit too much to fit in the weeks that we have now.
3:40
But it's possible to define these without using the ellipsis.
3:44
ISIS said that you can express through a predicate, you can take to the collection all the prime numbers.
3:49
And of course, I've written this here in words,
3:57
but I can translate this into a mathematical expression that expresses exactly states if the numbers prime number or not.
3:59
OK, a very special set is the empty set now.
4:10
And we will I will come back to this particular set a little later, because it's a very crucial definition inside the context of set theory now.
4:17
So this is the set that is now. So do we use the the zero with the slash through it as a denotation for the empty set?
4:28
You know, you can you can use both. Excuse me. I have this question.
4:37
OK, if somebody has their mike, especially if your mike, unless I have a question, I can hear people talk, especially if you're Mike when you talk.
4:42
He's disturbing the lecture. OK, so if you sat there and we can, because the inner said we can put any object we like,
4:54
you can also put sets in sets and so we can have nested sets it all perfectly fine.
5:05
And as I've said before, the description so the set constructions saying, well,
5:10
if I take all the actions to satisfy a particular predicate, that creates a set as well.
5:16
And so, as I said, it has to be precisely defined mathematical formula.
5:22
Now, people worked with this approach to set theory for a bit.
5:28
And then there was a clever young man in in England, Bertrand Russell, and he said, well, actually, this is nonsense.
5:32
Yeah.
5:42
And it was quite, quite a shock was Gioconda was a very well respected German mathematician, and everybody believed that he had found the right thing.
5:42
But Bertrand Russell pulled out a counterexample.
5:51
He pulled out a set an object, let's say that you can write down as using that particular notation, but you cannot show that it actually is a set.
5:54
So this means that you don't you are not as free as you are as you thought you were.
6:07
When you write down sets, you have to be very, very careful. And I will give you that example.
6:12
And this is a mind boggling event, so I hope you will.
6:17
You'll keep up with me. So they said that Russell said, OK, if I can write down anything I like in between curly brackets, how about this one?
6:21
I define ah as the collection of all the sets that are not an element of themselves.
6:32
OK, well you can think about this particular definition itself, which makes sense or not.
6:38
And then you could say, well, for example, the collection of all the infinite sets, that's an infinite set itself.
6:43
So the set of infinite sets is an element of the set of the infinite sets.
6:52
OK, so that's good. And then you have the set of finite sets.
6:57
For example, there's already the. That's not a good example.
7:02
No, it's not it is it is a good example, so to set a finite set, for example, it's an infinite set, you know, so infinitely large set.
7:09
So the set of all the finance is not a finite set and therefore is not an element of the set of all the finances.
7:18
OK, so we have two examples, infinite set and finance that set aside this this particular predicate in two ways.
7:27
So Bertrand Russell says, well, take all the sets, like, for example, the set of all the fine sets Sowden together,
7:35
put them in this box if they are not an element of themselves, OK, well defined, go to control and therefore is a set up.
7:43
Now, Russell says, OK, this particular set itself is by definition III in itself or it isn't.
7:51
Yeah, it's one of the two. So I an element of disconnection or it is not an element of the collection not being the thing itself.
8:02
So we have an all stable now. Yeah. So we deal with this, all the statement through cases.
8:11
So that's the first case. The first case. Well OK, let's take the case that as an element of all.
8:16
Yeah. Then by definition it is, it fits this description here.
8:23
Yeah. So that means that it is not an element of itself.
8:29
So if I'd known about far, then it is not an element of itself but itself as are.
8:36
And therefore, if I an element of fire, then as an element of not a modern element of fire.
8:41
OK, when I click on my screen, do you see the little books pop up with the enlargement?
8:49
Yeah, OK, good. Which is much better than pointing.
8:56
So this means that, OK, so this is of course not. This cannot happen.
9:00
So we cannot have two cases of ours inside and ours not. And so that's a contradiction.
9:04
Yeah. So this case is nonsense. So geolocation work.
9:08
So now I say are not an R and therefore R is just said that does not satisfy this predicate,
9:14
so therefore it is an element of itself because if it doesn't satisfy, that is not an element of itself.
9:22
Gaymer Bylaws Committee Middle. We have that. It is an element of itself.
9:29
So if I is not an element of R, then as an element of R and again we have a contradiction.
9:33
So this now gives me a proof if you like.
9:41
I just says that if this is set then I have a contradiction.
9:45
Now, both cases lead to the same conclusion, therefore we have a contradiction.
9:50
So therefore, the assumption that we had has to be rejected.
9:57
There's only one assumption in this particular case,
10:01
and that is that that that thing that I define is a set and therefore it is wrong, cannot hold and therefore is not dissent.
10:03
So that particular thing is not said, which means that you cannot write down anything you like in mathematics.
10:13
Now, you cannot just freely write down a collection and saying this has to be said, no, you have to be very, very careful with how you define the set.
10:19
So. Allowing yourself to write something,
10:30
saying take all the objects that take to satisfy a predicate that is not a valid construction, but you have to do it.
10:34
You have to say what said you take these actions from you and this is what I write under now.
10:42
So the only thing that's allowed to say, well, if I have a set, then I can take from that said,
10:49
all the elements that satisfy a particular property and this operation will give me a new set.
10:54
OK, so it is now gives you the bootstrap problem, so you have to have a set before you can construct a set.
11:01
So how do you start defining sets? This is part of what is called the seminal Frenkel action scheme, not part of the cause.
11:07
But I just mentioned it. It's a very, very well crafted set of restrictions and definitions through some of them pop up through intercourse.
11:17
But for the moment, it's important that the thing that makes it all work is the saying that the empty set is a sense now.
11:28
So the empty collection that is by definition is set and then you're allowed to do a lot of things that we are going to discuss in the course.
11:38
OK, so go ahead. Earlier you said that the subset of of a finite set is infinite.
11:46
How is that? I have difficulty here. Let me let me look at my volume control, which is lying here somewhere, buried musicI Nocturnes.
11:53
Yeah, can you repeat, please, you said earlier that said containing all the subsets of a finite set is infinite.
12:15
Is that can you please. No, no, no, it's not what I said. I said to the set containing all the finances, that's an infinite set.
12:23
Because they're are many finite sets. OK, thank you.
12:33
No, no, no. Did the collection of all the subset of the finance editor find?
12:37
I said good. OK, so.
12:42
One of the things that we are allowed to do is to create subsets,
12:48
so the subset is a is a construction that allows me to create a new set from a set exist.
12:53
And this is normally done through the predicate construction.
13:00
And we have the subset notation.
13:05
So we have that we can expose that as a subset of B through this this horse iron with the the horizontal line underneath it.
13:08
So this this is expressed as being a subset of B. Yeah.
13:19
And this is defined as a predicate. So if I want to show that something is a subset of something else, I have to build the proof for this predicate.
13:23
And a predicate says that for all X in A we have that X is an element of B now.
13:33
So if X is an element of A and B for every element in A.
13:39
Good, so we get some some clear examples where the proof is very, very short is, for example,
13:47
a subset of itself is straightforward to show that have access in aid and DNA for every aid.
13:54
The following two examples are easy because they are finite.
14:01
You just go through all the all the elements and ensure that you on the other side as well.
14:06
That end is a subset of ZET, for example. So the integers are so denaturalised and subset of the integers.
14:12
That is something that you can only show if you have a precise definition of them both now.
14:19
But. So this is one of the things that the way we are working with numbers now is a thing that we just postulate now.
14:24
So we know that a proof exists. We're not going to do the proof, but we accept this as true.
14:32
OK, so a lot of the things, as I said about numbers in this course, we are not going to to show, we just accept the entry.
14:38
Said, for example, is a subset of all the all the other sets in particular.
14:48
In this particular case, he said one, two, two, one, two, five. But you can show because the predicate is satisfied.
14:53
Yeah. So for all X in A we have X's in B,
15:00
so all the elements in the end he said elements of any other said Y because there are no elements in it in the empty set.
15:04
So it holds for all the elements that are in the set, which is num num num.
15:12
So quantification works over antisense.
15:18
The subset of who said I would reject those statements, we've just gotten on that, so I'll no break for a little exercise,
15:24
I want you to look at this for about five minutes and I'll come back and I'll do the.
15:34
Sorry, Stefan, the gone off on the on the screen.
19:04
Yeah, and I'm switching to a screen can write about music, OK.
19:08
So this particular statement is formulated exactly in the language that I've suggested to you about truth.
20:29
So we should be able to do this precisely using the methods method that I've presented to you.
20:39
OK, so first of all, first step in this, I need to translate this into something that I can actually work with.
20:46
Yeah. So the the tendency is to immediately dive in and and tackle the problem.
20:53
But I strongly suggest that you, first of all, make it make it more explicit.
21:01
So what I need to show and now I am looking up the definition of what this symbol means.
21:08
Yeah. So if. For all X and sorry.
21:13
A. We have X and B and for all Y and B, we have Y in C then for all said in A.
21:28
We have said is in C, yeah, so now I have stated it and let me bracket these things so it is clear what the scope for the thing is.
22:00
So one thing that I wanted to observe is that I've sort of baked X, Y and Z here.
22:11
It makes no difference because the thing is, the I can change X into a W as long as I do that as well.
22:16
So I can rename all the all the variables that occur on the quantifiers.
22:22
Yeah. Good, so what I can.
22:28
So I have two assumptions, two assumptions.
22:32
Know I'm not going to repeat them, but you can repeat them there if you like, so this assumption one and this is something to now.
22:40
So for while actually we have actually maybe this some wrong and for why and why and see this assumption to know, I need to show.
22:50
So I do. This is supposedly for all the said in a.
23:00
We have. That is in. Now, look, the showing for step, that means that.
23:08
We have. To show that a site.
23:19
That if A is an element of a.
23:29
Then Asian and see for an arbitrary or any, if you like, arbitrarily a in for any arbitrary object that satisfies the precondition,
23:34
which is the part in the F for that, I have to show that it is.
23:52
OK, so so this is what I need to show. So let's start proving that.
23:57
So take anatomy today. OK, now I go back by the first assumption.
24:01
Yeah, by the first assumption. And what I called.
24:08
Using all. No.
24:16
We get that, so this statement says all acts in A Acces and B, so we have one thing that isn't a small thing.
24:23
So damn 8:00 a.m. it'll be OK.
24:30
Similarly, by the second assumption and again, using for all we get a can see.
24:36
Now, so here I say take yeah, so all you can say, assume the same thing.
24:44
I should have said that before.
24:56
Yeah, so we have assumed that as a and any and then we have shown it then by the two assumptions that we have DAFWA agent on the scene.
24:59
So if he's a.
25:11
Then Asia and the sea or so it is, the proof that we have today's announcement is an assumption and a conclusion and see so by definition.
25:17
Of subset, we have that no say that's too fast.
25:35
I miss his step dad, so by showing for all.
25:41
We have and when you show for all it becomes to the individual that you've picked,
25:55
your anonymous individual that you picked gets again replaced by available for all Americans, the answer or why not?
26:01
So that said, Set said in a.
26:11
We have that and see, so by definition, after sunset, we get that A is a subset of.
26:17
OK, so for me to show this property, you can think out loud and say, well, if an animal is inside and it is in B and C,
26:37
so then it just pogo sticks from A to B, C and therefore an advertising agency.
26:46
But it's the intuition behind the Binta, the proof,
26:51
the proof has to be very specific in all the details and use the steps that we are allowed to make, which is what they've done here.
26:54
Any questions? So can we follow the implied stuff like Axium X belongs to A implies, X belongs to be something like that to prove that that's true.
27:09
That's true. So the so I. So if you go back to the slides which are Concierto and at the same time.
27:23
Yeah. So slide 29. So the subsid definition has this statement for all X element that we have actually intended to be.
27:29
Yeah. This is the this is different from the implies.
27:38
It is. You can build an implies in this step, but you, you are not going towards an implied statement but you're going towards it is the statement.
27:43
So the thing that you want to prove and bracketing in here to make it explicit.
27:55
Yeah. So this one that. So this is the thing that you wanted to prove, because that is what small subset means.
28:00
So there is no implies in a definition, a subset. So yes, you're right in the sense that you could from following this step here,
28:07
say therefore I have an implied but it would it would not bring you in the right
28:17
direction because it wouldn't bring you towards the thing that you have to show.
28:21
You see the difference, yes, it's a different definition wise to imply it's to subside,
28:27
so I could know so but I'm trying to say is that the construction of the proof is decided by what you are proving now.
28:36
So the formulation of the relation, that is the definition that we are working towards.
28:45
There is no implied in there. So in this particular point, in the proof you could do and implies.
28:51
But it would lead you astray because you can't go from it implies to this definition.
28:56
OK, I got that. Thank you. OK, OK. The two blanks represent the two assumptions valid to repeat, please.
29:02
The two blanks represent two assumptions. The first and second one, what do.
29:12
So I have two assumptions here. The answer to A is A subset of B and B subset of C, and they are translated in between there and there.
29:18
So this is the first assumption and it's the second assumption.
29:29
So I've marked in that one and two. So there is no implies in there either.
29:36
Is that what you meant? So I said before, I did approve, I've translated the subsid symbol into the subsid definition.
29:43
Yeah. Does this mean the same thing? OK, thank you.
29:57
Anybody else? So, yes, I tried to use, like, prettified contradiction.
30:06
That's OK, that's the wrong path. OK, I understand that.
30:16
The thing is, I'm so proofer a contradiction is a is a is a valid mathematical tool.
30:20
D in this cause I am ninety nine point nine percent sure I would have to check all the details.
30:28
None of that proves that I do to show the results that we need for the cause.
30:36
I don't prove a contradiction. So that is a is a very tempting step.
30:41
But students almost invariably make a mistake when they tried it now because they, they, they are so.
30:48
OK, let me give you an example. What so I've seen this many, many times in exams.
30:55
So students are asked to show a.
31:01
Proof be OK. And then the students say, OK, OK, I scratch their heads, scratch and I don't know.
31:07
But, you know, we clearly can't be false, you know? So let's try this.
31:13
OK, so I assume. Not now,
31:16
and I hope to cause the solutions and start writing right and writing about what they
31:22
do and so therefore so there's a lot of stuff happening there and therefore be.
31:27
So then now I have a proof copy and they say, aha, this is a contradiction.
31:36
OK. And I swear to you, this is so, so common contradictions, so refuse.
31:41
Not B and B holds.
31:56
OK, now I hope you can all see what's wrong here in the sense that this is an example of a proof
32:03
that goes astray and then comes back and forgets what it's doing because in this bit here.
32:12
Pichon. Which means all the all, all everything else is completely unnecessary because beholds you have shown that beholds.
32:22
So this is what I saw again. So very rarely does a student come up with to prove a contradiction, which is not an example of this now.
32:34
So I strongly suggest that you do not try to take.
32:42
OK, so I'm getting confused.
32:48
So what's the problem here? I can't see that kind of going kind finish, can I finish?
32:54
I will never ask you to prove a property that needs a proof, a contradiction.
33:01
OK, so whenever you have an exam or a test or whatever, if you feel tempted by doing a proof of contradiction, you're on the wrong path.
33:06
OK, there was a question starting that are interrupted, could you repeat, please?
33:17
No. OK. May I ask a question quickly before you continue to Shusha, OK, so you never ask us to prove by contradiction,
33:27
what would you what would you say we should use as opposed to that?
33:38
It's called the direct proof.
33:44
So this the property beholds here is proven directly, so an indirect proof is saying that it should not be and therefore a contradiction.
33:46
There's an indirect proof because you haven't shown that people should have shown that no P is false,
33:58
which is, if you think about it, a different thing, you know, for mathematicians, etc.
34:05
But that's all it's all true or false. It's all binary. And therefore it's OK.
34:10
But the point is, what you have shown is that no P is false.
34:15
You haven't shown at least. Now, so I'd like you to do it, so for me, the proof should be the construction of the truth of the statement itself.
34:19
That's ideally the situation. Not everything can be done like that.
34:33
We have seen examples and you can find examples in the notes.
34:36
For example, they can need proof, a contradiction.
34:39
But in the context of the course, we are in a very safe area of mathematics where we don't need a particular proof to.
34:42
So for the like the bottom one, which you said you can prove by contradiction, so it would be better.
34:52
But then also what I wanted to observe is that in the attempt to prove peace through proof, by contradiction to student proof spee.
34:59
As a proof. So instead, we should take cases.
35:10
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what I'm saying is because, I mean,
35:17
this this particular example that I give you a sketch of a programme, we don't know what you have no idea what B is.
35:21
So how you would actually prove B, that's a different issue.
35:27
The point is, what I'm saying is students are assuming no.
35:31
B and then the only contradiction you can build from that is showing P.
35:34
OK, thank you. Yeah, I know when you're showing people show you're doing what you're supposed to do, you you ask the show.
35:41
OK, so the thing is, it's a it's a trap for me proofer contradiction is that it's very important in mathematics.
35:50
I mean, many, many things are strongly depending on it.
35:58
The whole foundation set theory used as proof of contradiction massively.
36:03
But it's it's not what we want to do here. OK, I'm going to switch back.
36:08
Switch back, I hope. Excuse me while we talk, I'm going to switch to my window back here.
36:13
OK, just please go ahead. Yeah. So you are not supposed to do which we should try not to use by contradiction on a more general basis,
36:21
but in that sense, how should we deal with the what not.
36:31
So for example, also not NFL very in Pru's for example,
36:38
you can sort of something is not true and you do that by showing not so you have assume chumpy,
36:42
you go to a contradiction and then you say aha, not be. That's fine, that's perfectly OK.
36:49
And you will, you will see those things happening. But the I'm trying to switch to Hinduja.
36:55
Yeah. So not, not as a valid role in the, in the, in the context of mathematics.
37:04
That's not the point is the proper contradiction is there is a sledgehammer.
37:08
Now it is, it is an escape. It's the it's edited because otherwise they can't do a lot of stuff that that's why it's down.
37:13
So, for example, just as an illustration. Yeah. So the you are familiar with the notion of continuous functions in mathematics.
37:23
I think you've all seen them for you any level, are you.
37:32
Yes. Yes. OK, good. So there are two definitions for that. One of them says that for every environment around the the the X,
37:36
let's say you can find an environment around F of X such that all the elements in one environment get to the other environment.
37:46
So there's one definition. Yeah. The second definition says every sequence that goes to X corresponds to a sequence that goes after effects such
37:54
that the element of the first sequence element limit or second sequence is the limit of the original sequence.
38:03
Yeah, so those two definitions are both valid and defined in continuity.
38:11
But these that these things define the same thing. You can only prove using proof of contradiction.
38:16
Now, so the moment that you take out the contradiction, you lose that those things are the same and they become different cetera.
38:24
So it becomes a mess. So it is a very, very strong, valid point, but only if you do really the mathematics, which one we are not doing here.
38:31
OK, but, sir, in the case of not Evie Evie, the how should we remove by removing the dead and not in some cases.
38:42
The yeah, so what I'm saying is that you should not have a proof that starts with a negative negative assumption.
38:56
So all the things that we do in this course, you can show by assuming positive assumptions is basically there's no need to go back to the calls, ok.
39:05
OK, OK, good.
39:14
So we've done that exercise and might add on my key point is no longer connected.
39:19
So, I mean, Cuba does not a single area, so when we you know,
39:38
so we have defined since we have defined subsets, we know that we have to be careful when we define assets.
39:44
So how can we express the two sets are the same?
39:51
Well, we use the subsid equality as relation for that.
39:54
So the equality between sets is defined by saying A subset of B and B's, a subset of it, then A and B are the same set.
39:59
So that means that formally proving the two sets are the same is a proof of both these statements.
40:08
So it's an end to both. OK, sometimes it's easy and you can check immediately.
40:14
Like, for example, this particular case, this at ABC and NBC are equal said only because they'll find a way to go through them, you know.
40:22
So this is an example where we have two objects that are identical but are not syntactically the same.
40:31
Yeah. And you can compare this to things that, you know from mathematics.
40:38
So three plus four, for example, is equal to seven. These are not the same string.
40:43
So they are not equal as expressions, but they represent the same value now.
40:49
So it's the same holds here for the set. You can write down the sets in different ways, but they represent the same thing.
40:54
OK. So as I said before, the when you are showing the senses equal, you have to show that they are included in each other.
41:02
So so to prove to make them. Can we build new sets out of other existing sets?
41:11
Of course, we need to be able to do that because we cannot just vote on anything we like.
41:20
We have to start from sense where we build new sets. And so I go back to the first slide.
41:24
So we have this curly bracket notation. I allow this as the definition for national numbers are all the all the numbers that are there.
41:29
So I can, for example, take also said collection sets.
41:40
Yeah, there. That's all fine. And we have to.
41:44
Yeah. So we I allow a predicate to be used to construct a subset of the existing set.
41:49
Yeah. And I can do this by writing this particular predicate which is a valid mathematical product and therefore on the set as well defined.
41:57
OK, so what are my basic set of constructors, the ones that I work with.
42:07
Well first of all is the union and you can see here that I'm using the pretty good notation, but I'm not collecting from a set now.
42:13
So this officially is not a well defined set because I'm only allowed to take a formal collection now.
42:24
But this is added to the definitions of said by saying no, OK, this is safe.
42:32
Now, if you have two sets, you can put them together. You get what you get.
42:36
We call a new set. So we we extend the family of sets by this operation.
42:40
OK, so this is what we call an action. We can also build the intersection and now I can select from Circle and just take the union,
42:46
and so it's all the elements in the union of the two sets that satisfy two predicates.
42:58
Yeah. Or one predicates to such action. And it's an accident that can be.
43:03
I can look at said difference and difference, says A without B.
43:09
This is how this is pronounced and so does the Brexit notation.
43:14
There are different notations in the literature. We use the backslash.
43:19
This is defined in all the states in the union that say, well, actually an element in a annexe is not an element of B, and so it's a bit odd.
43:23
B we can talk about the semantic difference between two sets of triangle notation is used to that.
43:30
And this is the union of A or B and B without A.
43:37
And I can go to disjoined if the intersection is the antisense Tergat Shenoy elements.
43:44
OK, so we can define the intersection in different ways, like, for example,
43:54
all the data collection of all the elements in edit an element of B and I can define the difference in a similar way.
43:59
So this is not the only way in which you can define the intersection and that difference.
44:11
But as I find, this is the most workable way because it's easy to manipulate if you want to try and prove properties.
44:17
These two definitions are valid, but they give more complicated proofs now and union isn't assumed to create the set.
44:25
It is by definition a new set, not because she's selected from a set.
44:34
Last slide before the break, so we take two sets, for example,
44:43
one three five seven nine and three, five, six, 10 and 11, and then the union is all these.
44:47
So you take A and B, you throw them together at them instead of twice, you kick one out.
44:56
And this is the stuff that you get the intersection just as the elements that are in a in the audience.
45:02
And B and by careful consideration, you can see this set three and five A without B is the the set A without the elements that are in B as well.
45:08
And we've seen antedates three and five. So those are the two that you take out and then you can do B without a discussion is six,
45:19
then in the 11 and then the Z difference between A and B is able to be Union B without.
45:29
And that gives you this particular set there. Good, we'll have a ten minute break.
45:35
To the previous slide, please. Thank you.
45:57
I'm so used to that. Hey, what's up?
47:10
I just want to ask a question about the is it the party gave us a yes or no.
47:22
What's up with it?
47:34
Yeah, the last two, I think it's the last one where it says not Pewaukee, where it says not pure at the end, how are we supposed to do that?
47:36
Q And flies, not pork chop. Yes.
47:48
What's your question, sir? Yeah, I'm just asking because he said earlier you wouldn't need to use contradiction.
47:54
So I'm just wondering is if there's another way to do that on.
48:01
It's off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure I can't remember which direction, but I think it is in this direction and what direction.
48:10
I mean, which implies which that you should lead. You do need contradiction for that.
48:17
Oh. Yeah, I'm fairly sure any contradiction for me, but I'll get back to you.
48:24
So, uh. OK, double check the point that you should earn equal protection for the.
48:39
Yes, sorry, you could use Laura Extra, and it's just tends to be equivalent to a lot of metal would be a good one.
49:13
OK, thank you. OK, I'm make.
49:26
Hi, Stephanie. Yes, please, can I ask a question about you say the contradiction, not in general, but it's still finding you excluded middle.
56:25
Yeah, but that's basically the same thing. OK, the because you can show the one implies the other the.
56:38
But it is especially the the OK, if you ask my personal opinion,
56:48
I think the law of exclusion will use an approved as a more elegant and shows more
56:54
understanding than aiming for a contradiction assuming that something is false.
57:00
They are, because, like I said, the the proves that we do it never needs.
57:06
I actually the law is of middle is going to be used in an exercise pretty soon.
57:14
Yeah, but yeah, OK, so let's say it like this.
57:19
Let's assume so. Although these are basically the same thing as a proof step, they're very different.
57:22
Assume that something is false, hoping to come towards a contradiction, to show that it's true,
57:29
that is to prove technique that is not used within the context of the course within mathematics, very, very prominent.
57:34
But here it is not. So to admit, we will use an inference.
57:41
Nice. Good. OK, so.
57:47
We've looked at the the definitions, some examples, so over this particular collection of properties.
57:54
So obviously the definition that we've had so we have to set constructions in terms of intersection,
58:03
Union said difference and and the way we have defined equality on sets.
58:08
You can now write down statements involving sets and and and these operators and figure out whether or not the true or false,
58:17
you know, so the creativity, if you try to attend this particular proof.
58:27
So you need to show that a Union B is a subset of B Union A and B Union A subset of A Union B.
58:33
So for the first one, you take an element in a union B and then you know that either in A or D and B.
58:42
Yeah. And now remember that last election I showed you that P or Q implies Q or P, so no, you can use that property here and saying aha.
58:49
But if I have a as an element of age,
59:01
an element of B then by the property to have shown we can state that Asian element of B or Asian and I mean tuffet and therefore Asian,
59:04
that would be Union A. Now so it is a case where the property that you've shown before makes you prove a little lighter.
59:13
The same holds for the for the statement of the section.
59:22
We've shown that one as well. These are all fairly simple proofs and what I want you to do now.
59:27
So these are all provable properties and all of these things have to be assumed to be true.
59:36
So not actions. What I wanted to do now is show property one and property two now.
59:41
So translate this statement into an end in your statement and then do the reasoning about
59:50
the end and all statement to come to the thing that you have on the on the right hand side.
59:55
OK, good luck. So would it be all right if I brought them the first part and then the second one on?
1:00:00
So I did see you repeat, please.
1:04:57
Would it be all right if you showed us how to do the first part and then we had the second one?
1:05:01
Not at all. Just so we know that we are on the right path. Yeah, OK, I mean,
1:05:05
I'm actually writing down the answer at the moment so I can stop screen behind
1:05:11
me and do that because this is themes and everything and theme sticks forever.
1:05:18
So I'll I'll reveal what I'm doing by scrolling.
1:05:49
Yeah, so the statement that we have to show is that A Union, B Union C is equal to A Union, B, Union C.
1:05:52
OK, so what I need to show this is first of all, so there's two subsets here.
1:06:03
So I need to show all elements in the left and set elements in the right and.
1:06:09
So if for all X, if X is an element of a union, then actually an element of the other and vice versa.
1:06:14
So I need to show to reverse this right now. So the two parts of this group always took part in inequality.
1:06:22
So but I do know as I take an individual, I take an individual that satisfies the left hand statement exit.
1:06:30
So so I did approve using X and then I realised I should have written A and in.
1:06:40
Yeah. So I take in a sense that it is a part as an element of that set.
1:06:47
Now I look up the union and the union says, well then it is an element of the first set or there's an element of the second set.
1:06:53
So I have that as an element of a or is an element of B Union C and dealing with it.
1:07:01
So the proof is by cases now.
1:07:08
So assume that as an element of a then a is or is an element of B by using or now so I can add any statement I like to that particular thing.
1:07:10
No using or so by definition, no Saudi.
1:07:25
OK, well, I've written down here is just nonsense.
1:07:39
OK, so by this statement is known or is known to be, I know by definition and therefore is an element of the union of A and B,
1:07:44
OK, now this statement is true with or I can add anything I like and I need to work towards the fact that it is and C as well.
1:07:55
So I had the statement. So I know that this is true by using, by showing or again I know that it is an element of a union B or A not X,
1:08:04
A is an element of C and therefore by definition of union an element of A union B union C, OK, so is one part of the proof.
1:08:18
So in case my element is in A then I have the property.
1:08:28
Now, I think alternative to the second part of the union was that the Asian element of B or C,
1:08:35
so I know that an Asian admitted B is not A C, and therefore I'm working with CASIS.
1:08:44
Yeah, so now my case is a bit of A of B then access to be or an element of A by the oral statement
1:08:54
and actually what I want to do some of to swap D because I need to do it like this.
1:09:04
So X is an element of A union.
1:09:09
B OK, now as before I add the C statement, ok.
1:09:13
So I follow the exact same steps as above I now get and this should be an area, of course, about this now a is an element of a union, the union, see?
1:09:24
Yeah. And the second part is, I assume there is an element of.
1:09:39
Amazing to see.
1:09:48
And now I can say that there's an element of A or B Union B or an amazing element of C by showing or so I know that A is an element of A union,
1:09:50
B union, C now. So in this particular case, disapprove hereby cases gets concluded by saying so.
1:10:09
Both branches have the same conclusion. So I know that A is an element of A union, B Union C Now I know this proof here has the same conclusions.
1:10:23
So A is an element of A and B union.
1:10:36
C No. And therefore I have shown this for over A now.
1:10:42
So if A is an element of a union and B and C, then A is an element of A union, B Union, C, OK.
1:10:51
They want part of the proof, the other part of the proof goes in the opposite direction and is very, very similar.
1:11:10
The only thing is that the decomposition and the composition of the overstatements is in a slightly different rhythm question.
1:11:18
So you go ahead and say, for when I'm doing the proofs, I wrote a Albie's and like the letters or and like ants everywhere.
1:11:29
Is that still acceptable? It's an undoing, Hezbollah, as in like in some places,
1:11:37
if you that the symbol union and the simple intersection by just used and in those places and all.
1:11:43
Yeah, so that is wrong. OK, the in-between sets, the the the union symbol is a set operator.
1:11:52
The world ends and or are logical operators, they are in between things that are true and false.
1:12:01
So do things that in between sets which are not true or false, should be said operators.
1:12:08
And those are the intersection and the union. OK, yeah, ok.
1:12:13
So I hope you see in this particular example that the proof steps come back, you know, roaringly.
1:12:22
Because it's so I mean, this is the construction of the proof using those steps.
1:12:30
There's nothing magical happening here. No guessing, no oracle involved.
1:12:35
Yeah, just just doing the doing the steps, so the only but I do realise, of course, that there is a certain element of creativity involved.
1:12:41
So you have to see how to do the proof before you can write on the proof.
1:12:51
And, of course, the seeing of the proof that that's a tricky bit because you don't always see it.
1:12:55
So what I do here now is that it's why I made it explicit. So I've translated the statement that I need to show,
1:13:00
which is this equality there into a logical statement, into a mathematical thing that I can prove.
1:13:08
So I have now made it into a statement it has for all acts and then more a statement.
1:13:20
So this is what you always should do when you when you are asked to show a particular property that involves things that are defined,
1:13:27
you first of all, go to the definition and rewrite that they need.
1:13:35
You have to prove using the definition so that it becomes something that is more tractable in terms of proof steps now,
1:13:39
because this property here by itself with the union and equals has nothing to do with the proof steps that we've seen before.
1:13:46
And it's to prove that these symbols are not part of the proof steps that we've seen.
1:13:54
So you have to translate it into something that is formulated in terms of the logical connectors which end or implies for all there exist,
1:13:58
not now and then you can do the same here. It's a simple way to prove that.
1:14:08
I'm not saying that this is the only way to prove that. I'm saying that this is a proof.
1:14:13
So we are not in competition of who has to show proof.
1:14:20
Now, so you might well have a show to prove I'm perfectly happy with that, I'm not disputing that at all.
1:14:24
What they want to do is what I so I've done a my proof is specifically following the structure of the thing that you have to show.
1:14:29
OK, yeah, so what you could do is send me your proof.
1:14:39
What is the platform that we use for these students, staff, communications, DiPiazza?
1:14:46
Are you suggested to use Beltzer for that? No.
1:14:51
And then Edstrom, is it? Oh, God Almighty.
1:14:56
In order to. No one wants my password. OK, I need to raise it on the platform.
1:15:00
Can I suggest to you that you submit your proof there so I can look at it outside of the lecture?
1:15:06
Because it's otherwise because it slows down things tremendously. So I'm very much interested in your proof and I will comment on it.
1:15:12
But what you've sent me to do that through the platform, you will be OK.
1:15:18
You will be anonymous, Danso and then I'll I'll comment. OK, yes.
1:15:23
I can also describe it very quickly. So it's like we can do it twice.
1:15:29
You said your definition of of Junia I mean because finally said that people are
1:15:34
still a war appears to be people are able to just say and finally we can regroup.
1:15:41
Is that possible? So you could yeah, OK, so could I use this here, so difficult to say this to get Casey my point of there floating.
1:15:47
Yeah, yeah. OK, so this is the so when I assume that as an element of a then I as a single extra statement there,
1:16:04
I translated it into a union because then again I have a single statement.
1:16:13
I remember that all my proof steps, they talk about P and Q, they don't talk about P that is composed of certain things.
1:16:17
So if you are if you are doing things in one goal rather than two steps, you have to make sure that you are allowed to do that.
1:16:24
So can you prove that you are allowed to use that step? So that's the thing that should just the alarm bell in your head.
1:16:32
So you might have found a shortcut, but it might not be a shortcut that fits the profile steps that have given you.
1:16:38
OK, we must assume that I already belong to be your fiancee and make her Girardet to pay bills, to be your epitaph, to say we cannot skip this day.
1:16:45
So they did. What I think you are trying to do is you trying to do it without the brackets and the brackets should be there.
1:17:00
But again, we're going into too much detail into it. I wanted to submit it so I can comment so we can move forward now.
1:17:06
OK, OK, good. So the the second one is very similar.
1:17:13
The I can do so before we continue, so the reverse of this statement.
1:17:22
So what I say to vice versa. So when you go back, it's a very similar statement you're analysing.
1:17:30
All this gives you cases.
1:17:35
You have an element in there or you have the element in A or B or you have an element and see if you have an end in A or B, the gang of cases.
1:17:37
And so what I do here is I very methodically build up the statement that I need to show.
1:17:46
Yeah. So all three cases finish with the same.
1:17:52
The same statement now, and you need to do the same thing where you go in the in the opposite direction,
1:17:56
so you're moving towards a an element of the union of A and B and C.
1:18:02
And so you have to be careful where you at yours. OK, then if you have to like that, you have to prove vice versa.
1:18:10
Do you have to, like, write each of these steps or is there some way you can, like, simplify it?
1:18:20
Because you've shown it once or sometimes. Sometimes you can.
1:18:27
Sometimes you can simplify it by for example, we will see proof that if you read the proof backwards, you get the proof in the opposite direction.
1:18:31
Yeah, we will have those occasions. In this particular case, it's not true because we have a different thing, what you can do, for example.
1:18:38
So but again, this needs writing down. You need to argue this is that you use the fact that you can sort the the components in an overstatement.
1:18:48
Yeah, so it has to do. Not even that. No, no, no, no, no.
1:18:59
In this particular case, though, is the path backwards is similar, but different from the path in the first direction.
1:19:03
Yeah. So in terms of answers for exams, I in this particular case, I would accept,
1:19:10
if you write down the proof in the other direction is similar, but for the fact that the order of the universe is different.
1:19:18
Yeah. So you can argue that the proof is similar, but you have to justify why it is similar.
1:19:26
Just saying to prove is similar. That is normally not going to work out.
1:19:32
Students make very bad guesses that way when they prove the opposite direction is very different and they're right to prove similar.
1:19:36
No, not true. Yeah. So you have to understand the proof going backwards.
1:19:44
And then in this particular case, I would say, OK, you've got to prove in one direction,
1:19:48
in detail I believe you can do to prove in the other direction as well, because you have observed that proof similar.
1:19:52
You understand what I'm saying there?
1:20:00
So sometimes you don't have to give the full answer in the other direction, but only if you can argue that you have basically already done it.
1:20:02
Yeah, OK, good. Because this this is explicitly only showing from left to right.
1:20:11
You know, this is not going from right to left at all. Now, this all this shows me this the set inclusion.
1:20:18
Yeah. So what I have here is the conclusion to this proof is saying so A union B Union C is a subset of A union B C yeah.
1:20:24
So this is not the equal equality at all. No.
1:20:40
So what we still need to do is this. But OK, so is there any need or interest in me doing the the second one.
1:20:45
Yes. Please, because I'm trying to understand how to use B intersection C.
1:20:58
OK, OK, OK, OK, good, good. OK, so there's always helpful if you even an exam,
1:21:06
you need to think that you need to show because if you make a mistake and copying that information, then I can see that you make a mistake.
1:21:26
Otherwise, you dive into the proof and then I go and see what a mistake is coming from.
1:21:33
By the way, another very, very important advice for all of you.
1:21:39
Make sure that you read the question. Yeah, I see too many students very, very quickly starting to answer the question.
1:21:43
And then I forget to come back to the question and see that there are two more things asked for that they don't reply to.
1:21:52
You know, you lose points. You know, if you give a partial answer, you get partial marks.
1:21:58
So please read the discussions carefully. OK, so we need this.
1:22:03
OK, first. So subsect, yeah, and so take us.
1:22:07
Let me try to be complete, so to show for all X in A, B, C, we have X and A, B and C. So this should be a union.
1:22:21
OK, so take an A in that sense.
1:22:49
Then X in an A or B and C by cases.
1:22:59
It's again, so I'm guided by the order. So X isn't a so assumed this.
1:23:09
So I need to go to AZ and acts as an element of the union would be intersecting the union, see, OK, so I need to show.
1:23:19
Yeah, that X is an element of the first set and actually the second set excuse me, I'm in a union B and X is an element of a union C.
1:23:31
OK, so this is a side remark for myself just to tell me what I'm doing.
1:23:46
So the first step you just let go.
1:23:52
OK, it's just that you've written take a as an element of stability, X or not.
1:24:01
No, no, no. So just the X is a variable and A is a unknown but concrete element.
1:24:08
Yeah. So OK, thank you. OK, that was not the question for the other one as well.
1:24:16
OK, OK, so I need to show this. How do I show this, OK.
1:24:27
Well, I need to show that it is an element of the union with B by showing all I have that Asian I'm A.
1:24:32
Or Asian, I mean to be so by definition of union A is an element of A or B.
1:24:49
Yeah. And similarly. You know, by showing or Asian and they or Asian, I meant to see so by definition of union as an image of a union, see.
1:25:04
Yeah. These both hold.
1:25:20
So a of a C intersection, so is B intersection A, C by definition of intersection.
1:25:28
Everybody happy? OK, so I'm allowing myself to see similarities between the reasonings and saying,
1:25:48
well, I'm doing the same thing, that I don't need to repeat everything. I just say, well, did I get this?
1:25:57
OK, so it is Longpont. And I saw this assuming an element in a and is this.
1:26:02
No. So that's gone. So the other assumption is there is an element of B and C and so by using or using N not.
1:26:18
So by definition of intersection definition of intersection X is an element of B and X is an element of C,
1:26:34
then by using or you have X is an element of am I doing this right here.
1:26:52
Yeah, I know that actually segment of A or X is an element of B and by using all along.
1:27:02
Acts as an element of a or accidental see by now so so acts as an element of a union
1:27:17
B and acts is an element and I'm using ecstasy and everything should be an idea.
1:27:31
Sorry about that actually element of a union C so X is an element of A union.
1:27:39
B in the S. The Union C.
1:27:49
You're very, very patient, listens, because I did a lot of things wrong here,
1:28:10
so there's always this should all be a scientist who you ought to do approve curriculum also teach myself.
1:28:16
Yeah, good. So I have now that a is an element of this particular set.
1:28:30
So I've got the same conclusion that. So the conclusion of this all proof is on.
1:28:36
A is an element of a union, B, intersection A, union C, so this is true.
1:28:47
So for all X, X is an element of a union P, intersection C and X is an element of a union P.
1:29:00
Sorry, you know, bad music, I'm just finishing this.
1:29:26
Yes, please. I have the question about the part where we assume that a day belongs to the intersection, see,
1:29:38
so here we say then by using or why don't we use it then by showing or because we want to prove this case.
1:29:50
OK, yeah. No, you're right. You're right. You're right. This is the wrong name, not just for this show and also in the next Lyonya.
1:29:58
I hear something beeping, he said, I said, no, I don't know what goes on.
1:30:20
OK, good. So they are so it is to move in one direction.
1:30:27
So we have to. So I right here, I have no idea.
1:30:31
I tried to narrow down this nonsense, so this should be the subsect.
1:30:36
OK, so the proof in the show, no,
1:30:44
you can't possibly argue that the proof in the other direction is similar because it's you start from a very different departure point.
1:30:48
No. So you really have to do to prove in the other direction as well.
1:30:58
It's it's the same technique. OK, any questions?
1:31:04
Question a question for last line of what we use is a subset of instead of equal because we have only shown if then yeah,
1:31:16
so we have shown that if Adam is in this set, then the element is in that sense, we haven't done the opposite direction.
1:31:29
Oh, so they need to go back or they can go back.
1:31:39
So I don't so, so explicitly showing subsid here.
1:31:43
And that's the only thing I'm doing, not and not showing quality at all.
1:31:53
So second part. Yeah, so the second part is shown to the subset relation in the other direction.
1:31:57
OK. So mistakes like these that I'm making here,
1:32:14
then using showing rather than using those are just slips of the pen in the sense that you
1:32:18
don't don't think that you are destroying your answer if you make a slip up like that.
1:32:24
You know, when I Mark, I very much look for a.
1:32:28
Do you understand what you're doing? Yeah, that's that's my main interest.
1:32:32
Have you understood what we discussed in the course that you pick up the techniques that are trying to show you?
1:32:37
And do you understand what you're doing and then you can slip up and there's no no damage done this perfectly.
1:32:43
OK, so for example, there are people who make a mistake when they copy out the formula and then I, I market looking at it.
1:32:49
If this is the question that they're trying to answer, are they still answering it the correct way?
1:32:58
Yeah. So the. The imam has everybody in the department.
1:33:03
We are very, very lenient benchmarking to make sure that we don't punish you too much,
1:33:10
but you have to be very careful and be sure that all these things that I've said,
1:33:17
that you understand what you're doing, that you have understood the techniques, etc., that you that you are really there.
1:33:22
You know, so this and this is only achieved by by hard work.
1:33:28
Unfortunately. Good.
1:33:32
Let me go back to the sleights. Or, you know, showing us from the other direction.
1:33:35
I'm not doing it, no, no, no, because this is the I mean, it's very similar.
1:33:48
The only thing is it's a different decomposition. If you understand what I'm doing here, I suggest you try for yourself.
1:33:53
If you are in doubt, put your answer on Piazzi and we'll have a look at it.
1:34:02
Yeah, we are pressed for time. We can't go through all everything in all detail,
1:34:06
but I hope that gives you enough detail for the first part so that you know how to tackle the second part.
1:34:13
Look pretty.
1:34:20
Good, I will skip this one, we'll start at the next election with this exercise is very nice and it comes back to the thing that we've just done.
1:34:26
No, no, not not yet. Not yet. OK, good.
1:34:37
So a way of drawing sets is used as Venn diagrams, and they're very nice because you can you can talk about it quite easily using a diagram.
1:34:40
The only problem is that they become an unreliable source because it depends on how skilled you are with pen and paper.
1:34:52
And that might not doing drawing as you'd say. You might make mistakes when you do that.
1:35:01
Yeah. So, for example, I cannot take two sets.
1:35:06
Yeah. And draw them on top of each other, make sure they overlap.
1:35:10
And then I can talk about the union, the whole area.
1:35:14
I can talk about the intersection which is just the area in the middle.
1:35:18
And I don't understand why it doesn't show my shading. I mean, on my screen, the shading disappears a bit.
1:35:23
It's annoying. OK, the you can take Togba said exclusion so a bit I'll be the area shaded on the left and
1:35:29
the I can talk about the difference and that's the everything but the intersection.
1:35:42
No. So that's all fine. It's very nice to, to draw and to make diagrams with but it's, it's dangerous.
1:35:48
So for Doucet's it's easy and have these all possibilities are there for three sets.
1:35:55
You can say, OK, I draw a third set on top and everything is still hunky dory.
1:36:02
But then how do you put the fourth set in there? So would you do this?
1:36:07
I now give you a few minutes to stare at this, and then I want you to tell me if this is the right diagram or not.
1:36:16
Is there any in the end, I would say the room, but your area around the country at the moment,
1:37:11
is there anybody in the in the student population today who thinks that this is incorrect?
1:37:17
Well, can you repeat your exact question, please? The exact question is on the on the on the slide.
1:37:26
There's no end to Section four and it need to be three D.
1:37:34
Yes and no. What do you mean there is no intersection and this clearly there because it was you know,
1:37:41
it's it's this area here is just indie and not B and C, OK, good.
1:37:50
Yeah. So there is no. So the the elements that are in a and indeed and not in C and not in B are not there.
1:37:59
OK, and similarly with B and C. Yeah. But you can also also make the following observation.
1:38:08
Being inside a set is a boolean as true or false, you know, so you can represent the receiver one the being inside B zero one being inside,
1:38:15
C zero one being inside dcom with four digits you can represent 16 different positions.
1:38:26
This diagram has only 14. Now, the to the missing are exactly the two that you just mentioned, you know,
1:38:35
so but what I wanted to say is that it's very tempting if you talk about four sets that you start with this example.
1:38:48
I say, well, OK, I'll just draw the Forcett on top and then I start thinking about what happening here.
1:38:58
And the point is that this diagram is wrong now.
1:39:03
So Venn diagrams are nice, too, but only in very simplistic situations, you know, drawing the correct.
1:39:06
So you can do this in 2D, but you have to make sure that you are basically in your basically drawing something like, oh, no, I can't do this here.
1:39:13
So you're basically drawing something here.
1:39:24
Yeah, so you have to you can't do a nice oval, you have to do something and the examples in the notes, the how to do it at four cents.
1:39:28
OK, so if the I should only be used intuitions only to check your insight,
1:39:40
it's never approved because you can make very easily a mistake and you don't see that you make a mistake.
1:39:45
Good. So some counterexamples against the statements that we have,
1:39:52
so you might think that you can freely manipulate a union intersection or end and or for that matter, because there's strong correspondence.
1:39:57
So, for example, is the statement the union of A and B and C is equal to the union of A and B and C, and the problem is no.
1:40:05
Yeah, so it is you have to be careful what you do that can easily give a number of sets that make a counterexample.
1:40:17
So if I asked you to verify if a particular property is correct, then if you think it's correct, you have to give me a proof.
1:40:27
If it is not correct, then you give a counterexample. So you take individuals for statements should hold.
1:40:35
But first, the statement doesn't. Oh.
1:40:41
Yeah, so it's the same kind of statement. So now I am put into brackets in the wrong way, I should have been better to use tuning them,
1:40:47
but it's so I reorganised the statement and again, there's a counterexample for that.
1:40:59
No. Good.
1:41:08
The. And I'm trying to think if I should pop into the next topic on which can to stop, I think it's best if I stop.
1:41:14
So I will I will come back in the next lecture to this property here.
1:41:28
Yeah, you can. So this is an example where we need the law to screw the middle.
1:41:35
So we tried to exercise for yourself. You take an element in V and then you add the information that the element is either in W or not in W.
1:41:41
Yeah. So you have a need or consideration and it gives you this particular statement.
1:41:53
There you. Yeah. So in this particular case, the equality between those two sets needs the law.
1:41:58
The school needs that an element is in W or not W good.
1:42:07
I have four minutes left for some, some final questions for today's lecture.
1:42:14
Anybody at all. Can you use the Morgens laws onsets if you prove them, if you prove them?
1:42:20
So it is basically. So give, give, give, at the Morgan Law, for example, what is the Morgan Law?
1:42:33
I like and B is equal to not A or not B and then not all that, OK, what is not for since.
1:42:41
The compliment. Have we talked about that yet?
1:42:54
No. OK, so they so I saw this particular problem is postponed.
1:42:58
But what you need to do there is that you can only use things that you have shown now.
1:43:05
So, for example, I've shown you that you can swap the order of the participants in an end statement, in an earlier statement.
1:43:11
So we don't have to prove that, again, this particular property that you want to prove now that you want to use.
1:43:18
Now you are you are postulating it. I haven't shown it.
1:43:24
You haven't shown it. And therefore, it's it's up in the air. So you can only use it after you have shown it.
1:43:28
Right. OK, yeah, so this means, again, these are the complement will be translated into not you're right,
1:43:38
but then you have a statement about end and or negation and you have to translate into another statement and the more negation.
1:43:46
And you have to do that after that is that you are permitted to do that.
1:43:54
And once you have the proof, then you can say and therefore on the level the sets, I'm OK.
1:43:58
And therefore and from that moment on, you can do it, but you have to prove it first.
1:44:03
So this is this is a a bootstrap election, so we only use stuff that we've shown apart from the stuff and basic basic arithmetic.
1:44:11
And assuming that's not in P is the same statement as X is not in P, E is not to be.
1:44:26
They yeah, so the the the X element with a slice through it, a it's the same as saying not X element A get your question.
1:44:39
Yes. Thank you. OK. And I think if you if we go back to the slides, we can even say that where is the.
1:44:56
So we say is an element of a now and write a note element of a when it is not.
1:45:14
Yeah. So they say, OK. Now, so a as a statement, as an element of the negation of that is not a amount of a which you can write as a not element A.
1:45:22
OK, I could have made it explicit on this slide. I think it's in the notes, it's in more details and I can't stress this enough.
1:45:37
I read the notes, read nods, read the notes. You know that you're in college now.
1:45:46
You cannot hope to pass this exam if you just start revising the weeks before the exam is not enough.
1:45:52
You have to constantly revise during term for all courses or topics.
1:45:59
It's too much work. Otherwise you will miserably fill your exams if you do it in a different way.
1:46:04
And so I have written the notes for that purpose.
1:46:10
So go through them, go through your notes and make sure that you revise and come back to the problems and ask me questions on Pianta.
1:46:13
I'm very, very available to everybody to help out.
1:46:22
Not as much during the lecture because there's no more press time.
1:46:27
But outside of the lectures, a lot of space to go into details which was reflective of problems that you might have.
1:46:30
Can I just quickly ask in the exams the stuff we can assume are in the notes and we don't we can't see stuff we've done in lesson on.
1:46:39
No, you can. You can. You can tell there's no distinction. It's like I sat at the exam.
1:46:48
Do you start from the notes, the slides, what I say and what I think know.
1:46:54
So that's all these things combined. That's the big knowledge supposedly supposed to know the in an exam.
1:46:59
I will ask you to prove things. And if I if you have the the freedom to use stuff from the knowledgeable,
1:47:06
normally say something like if you use things from the notes, please state explicitly what it is that you use.
1:47:13
But I might ask you to prove a thing that is proven in the notes and then you have to know the proof and repeat the proof.
1:47:19
Okay. Thank you. OK, that's it.
1:47:27
Thank you for your attention. Six o'clock, everybody's hungry, let's go eat.
1:47:32
Yeah, good. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you.
1:47:36
Thank you.
1:47:41
