Title: Q&A3
Category: COMP40017 - Linear Algebra (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Chiraag Lala
Hello. All right, people on Zoom and my audible.
0:07
Yes, I can hear both you.
0:13
We'll wait for a couple of more couple of minutes for everyone to join in on this story.
0:24
In the meantime, if you have any questions, you can Typekit in the chat and I have a look.
0:37
I can ask one question Are you good?
0:44
Oh yes, Richard, go ahead.
0:59
What's your question? I did not elaborate through.
1:07
You can elaborate. In the meantime, I'll find out.
1:22
I'll also get started in the lecture theatre lifestyle.
1:27
All right, everyone. We'll get started.
1:58
There's a question in the in the chat.
2:03
The first question in the chat is could you please go over the inverse matrix inverse of the of a four by four matrix in the lecture?
2:12
OK, we can do that. OK, let's do that first, then.
2:25
So I have to say.
2:34
OK, so the first question is how to compute the invoice using of a four by four matrix using the course elimination.
2:42
It does it. Single elimination, OK, it doesn't say, but we use because an elimination method to compute the inverse of a code by four matrix.
2:51
And I'll use an example. But perhaps I'll ask you to give me the end piece of the Matrix A and.
3:04
And the we. OK.
3:25
This is the Matrix A. And this is going to be.
3:31
Look, this has got to be a four by four matrix, and this one's got to be a full oops.
3:43
A four by one matrix, so yeah, any big issue would be that you'd like me to.
3:54
Can you proposing these for The Matrix and be any random number?
4:05
Or make sure it's not a sex question?
4:12
OK. Yes, I think so. One or three?
4:17
Seven. The. There are very.
4:24
To sit. Go ahead, go ahead.
4:31
Six four four one zero zero zero zero five four minus one minus two for one.
4:36
You sure this is not good.
4:50
I trust you. I trust. No. All right. Anyone else in these for the better?
4:54
Sorry. Seven feet 17. Well, minus two zero zero for four.
5:02
All right. These are randomly. These numbers are randomly generated by our pupils in the classroom.
5:14
All right. So first, you create an augmented matrix of the Matrix Matrix A and B, and it will look something like.
5:24
Again, I'm going to end one four three seven two zero three two six four one zero zero minus one minus two one.
5:39
Put our bodies to differentiate between A and B.
5:52
And then 17, minus two zero four.
6:00
OK. And the approach the first step would be.
6:06
I'll have to keep moving this. So what should be the first eliminate operation anyone?
6:18
What what what do you think should be the operation that you should carry out?
6:27
I would I want the first the first set of rule operations should target these entries to be zero, the third.
6:33
These are already sealed, so we don't need to worry about the third rule.
6:43
What about the second and the third? We don't need to worry about the photo.
6:48
What about the second and the third group? What should be two operations?
6:52
Go ahead. Say it's great to be part of the group?
6:56
That's correct. So let me write first. So I will replace, wrote two to be wrote two minus two times row one and.
7:02
The pope very, very, very, very.
7:15
Row three should be ruled three minus six times.
7:20
Rule one. OK, so when you do these operations now, let me create some more space.
7:25
OK. So when you. Do these operations you get?
7:40
A matrix which looks like one, four, three seven.
7:48
17. You get zero war you and then zero minus two times four would be minus eight.
7:55
Three minus two times three would be minus three. Two times two minus two, the best seven would be minus two L.
8:05
Minus two. Minus two, down 17 minus thirty four, minus six.
8:17
So is the second row correct? Can anyone verify?
8:26
Yep. And you keep doing this for the current anyone for the third row.
8:32
Very quickly, it will be. Zero.
8:40
Four minus six times 420 minus twenty one, minus six times minus 17.
8:49
Zero minus six times, seven. 42, minus 42.
9:01
Zero minus six times 17. So I'm just going to write minus six times 17 of sorry for interruption.
9:08
Would that be a bit easier if we do like grocery equals to grocery minus three times right to do that?
9:16
Yeah, we like to use the size of the numbers. A lot makes the calculation easier.
9:23
That's perfectly fine. Yep, yep. That's also fine, what I am following is a system is an algorithm approach, which computers used to.
9:27
Which, you know, Mac software is like MATLAB. Use the computer.
9:41
The reduced low clone from using this approach.
9:47
But what you have suggesting is also perfectly fine.
9:53
So someone on the JAG said that perhaps we could have used it instead of taking six times for the third row,
9:55
replacing per rule by R3 minus six times R1.
10:05
We could have also done all three.
10:11
Is it going to R3 minus three times R2?
10:15
That's also perfectly acceptable, but you have to do this before the before that operation,
10:20
before the first operation, that first elementary operation that I've proposed.
10:26
This is also perfectly acceptable. So right now, your objective is to make all the entries in the first columns,
10:33
you wrote all the entries below one to be zero in the first first column.
10:40
Yes, that's correct. OK.
10:46
So let me just complete the first step.
10:51
OK. Now. Now, I'm not going to spend the entire lecture just solving this problem, but you keep.
10:58
Doing these operations. Until.
11:10
You have. Matrix, you have the augmented matrix, which looks like something like one one.
11:19
There could be another. No. You're maybe two, I don't know.
11:38
And then one. And then. Let me.
11:45
One one. To. One.
11:56
So you see those. Everything else, is this just an example?
12:02
Then you might you might get some numbers on the right, which you should have actually sold it properly, otherwise it can be misleading.
12:13
But the idea is that your non-zero ends should follow some form of a staircase light like structure.
12:22
All right. It should follow. So these are called pivots.
12:34
And you need to ensure that your clinics are.
12:48
The period of a given role is to the right of the period of a breach of the rule about.
12:56
OK. And. That said, actually, I.
13:04
I should have completed there could be no easier. I think.
13:16
Some people a lot. Let's go about solving effect two very quickly.
13:23
OK. So the next step would be if you're trying to calculate the inverse shouldn't be augmented matrix containing the inverse.
13:37
Sorry, the identity. Oh yes, I figured the question was how to compare team bus.
13:56
I am so sorry, I just go directly to solving it.
14:01
So to compute the inverse, the approach is different. I apologise for this.
14:05
Actually, my question was about solving, so if you can elaborate on this one.
14:16
But the question about solving first, really first, focussing on the question on solving.
14:28
A system of linear equations. So the idea is to get this reduced clone form.
14:37
And once you have the reduced role on foreign. It should look something like.
14:44
Something like the don't the thing that I showed previously. When you have one one, there could be one.
14:53
All right, let's take the simplest case where you might get an identity matrix, OK?
15:09
Everything else is zero. And then on the right to be.
15:18
That would be some other numbers, like maybe three, four, five six.
15:26
When you come after performing such elementary rule operations, you might get a matrix, which augmented matrix, which looks like this.
15:35
And then this simply implies that.
15:45
Your. X1 is equal to the three X2 is equal to four.
15:51
X3 is equal to fight and X4 is equal to six.
15:59
This is I'm assuming there is a unique solution when you solve this, when you perform these elemental operations to get the reduced on form.
16:05
Suppose there are. Suppose you get something like this when there is a zero in the last year, there is not no pivot in the last four.
16:18
OK. Imagine. Oops!
16:32
When I lost Connexion. The firefighters lost connexion.
16:53
I imagine the last straw in this matrix as only zero entries.
17:31
And on the right you have a nine zero eight three six. All right.
17:36
In that case, what does it mean?
17:41
It basically means that zero times x one zero times x plus zero times plus zero times x four is equal to six, which is a contradiction.
17:43
It cannot happen, right? So in that case, no solution exists.
17:54
All right. So one I I just showed you.
18:00
As an example of having a unique solution to.
18:05
That's an example of no solution where you get a rule with only zero entries on the left hand
18:10
side of this vertical bar and a non-zero entry on the right hand side of the vertical bar.
18:18
That is the situation for no solution. I'm for any final solution.
18:24
Now imagine that the last straw has only zeros.
18:29
Also, there's a zero on the right hand side of the work, it goodbye, but instead of six or there there is a zero body.
18:34
All right. In that case, this system of linear equations is now reduced to three.
18:42
There are three linear equations. There are not four inadequate. Now you have a trillion equations with four unknowns.
18:48
Go back to the first stop that I had when I said that you couldn't find too many solutions, if you if you can remember.
18:58
Yeah. So the basic idea is to use elementary raw operations to get this reduced through a long form
19:06
of the matrix a while from the same operations on the right hand side of the particle board.
19:15
And you will get get the desired result.
19:21
Same with inverse within words instead of B vector on the right hand side of the vertical, but you need to replace it with.
19:27
Identity Matrix Identity Matrix is a matrix, which has one along the diagnosis, zero zero every minutes.
19:36
And they just performed the same operations until you get an identity matrix on the left hand side of the vertical bar.
19:45
And then on the right hand side of that vertical body, you get the inverse of that original matrix.
19:54
Those are the steps. Unfortunately, my iPod is still not connecting.
20:00
Are you using the whiteboard in the last lecture that you use the camera to show us?
20:08
I know my iPod is not working. Not connecting at all.
20:15
So even in the lecture theatre, they can't see anything.
20:19
They're seeing the same screen as you can see.
20:26
What I wanted to ask is if there are no zeros at the start of The Matrix, then how do we what's the intuition that we should be making this digital?
20:30
This particular element? This element? There are no zeros in the beginning.
20:38
Yeah. Yeah, you perform the same operations to get the reduced rate to learn from that need not be a zero to begin with.
20:44
Did I understand your question correctly? Do you have you still have a. Difficulty to understand.
20:58
It seems so, so consider we made the column entries in the first column, zero under one.
21:09
Then the next step would be to make the entries one column, one row below those to be zero.
21:16
Yeah, the ideal. Ideally, you would want one along the diagonal.
21:24
And zero, everybody's ideally speaking. OK.
21:30
But sometimes that is not possible.
21:38
And when that is not possible, there are only two options you get either infinitely many solutions or you get no solutions.
21:40
Is that making sense? Yeah.
21:49
So question is this in four excellent form or not?
21:55
So is this is this an act on form? Yeah, the identity matrix isn't really a clone form.
22:00
I thought that the votes had to have all the entries at the bottom for it to be in written form.
22:08
No, no, no, no, no, no. The condition for a clone form.
22:13
There are two conditions for influence on either if if there is a rule which has all zero entries.
22:18
Then that rule has to be at the bottom of the matrix. But if there are no rules with all zero in place, then that's fine.
22:27
You need not worry about that. Then the only only the only thing you need to ensure is that the pivot follows a staircase like structure.
22:37
The bricks are arranged along the diagonal or base, or it need not be a diagonal.
22:46
But the pivot should follow a circuit structure where the pivot of a particular row is to the right of the pivot offer of a row about.
22:55
Yeah, OK, thank you, that makes sense, right? OK. All right.
23:05
There are many questions that I think, OK, Inverse of Matrix done.
23:11
So. Is the algorithmic approach to always add or subtract from one?
23:23
So there's a question would say which asks, is this systematic?
23:42
Is this an elimination process? Do we have to only use our one, not in practise in MATLAB, and if you are if you're going to code,
23:47
if you're going to create a programme for this process, then you might consider OD one only, but you can.
24:01
Have other approaches as well. You need not considered one only.
24:10
Can you perhaps one question is,
24:21
can you perhaps stake up any part of Question one from Tutorial and Solvex so we can get an idea about the best algorithm?
24:23
You can do that in the tutorials widget. So there's a question which is.
24:33
Can I go through the through a question in the tutorials you are your tutors will help you understand this process.
24:41
So I leave it to them. Next question is, instead of making it in the reduced through a clone form.
24:51
Can we just get the solution from the Reduce Ekland form? Is there like a preference?
25:00
I know you can get the solution from introduce a cloned form as well.
25:07
It's just that I think it is much easier if you go all the way down to the REDUCE-IT Oaklawn fault.
25:12
It simplifies to a great extent when you try and solve it, you'll understand what.
25:19
Well, you can you can. You need not follow the Gorshin elimination process at all, you can, you know, starting from scratch just.
25:26
Keep replacing and get the solution without following this approach.
25:37
Next question, do the pilots have to be directly to the right of the line about no.
25:44
Not they have to be to the right, they can be two steps to the right.
25:50
For instance, again, I can't draw on the.
25:55
No, it's not going to be the pivots can be two steps to the right as well.
26:02
Yes, a question, but that's. This is fine, this is fine.
26:09
The problem is my iPad is not going to. And without congressman, I think a white board.
26:17
Typekit right there. Connecting directly to the.
26:39
Again, I'm just worried that you could take a lot of time to do that.
26:55
You kind of just right on the life lecture in sports and you just livestream, so recover on a typical online.
27:00
OK. So I.
27:10
But is there a lot? OK, let me try this once again.
27:19
Anyone in the. Do you have any questions which I can explain in words and not really use the whiteboard?
27:45
I want to get rid of those questions first and only then.
27:52
Yeah, could you look for additional produce for?
27:56
Definition of reduced through a grant from OK one. So, number one, it needs to be on form, so have you understood that?
28:03
All right. Basically. All the entries below the predicts should be zero.
28:15
That is through a conflict in the reduced rate from.
28:23
All the Pivac's side one and all the entries below and about that, the risks are also zero.
28:29
Does that make sense? Do you say that again, please?
28:39
OK. Yeah.
28:43
Reduced through a clown farm is a rogue long form in which the bewick and these odd one bigwig basically means the first nonzero in three in a row.
28:46
OK. And all in above and below the pivots are zero.
28:57
OK. That is the reduced rate on. Yes, they can get this.
29:08
Identity matrix is one example of a reduced rate going on.
29:16
Now imagine another picks where you have.
29:23
Let's see identity matrix and all zeros as an important technology that is also used to make landfall because there are no in that group.
29:28
Okay. And is it necessary that we have a reduced form in order to solve a question?
29:41
No. Again, as I said earlier, this is one way of solving a system of linear equations.
29:48
This is how computers used to solve. This is an algorithmic, systematic approach to solve a system of linear equations and dissolve MATLAB,
29:56
and you can resolve it with, like a reduced example instead of instead of attributes.
30:06
Yes. Yes, you can do that. You can do. That is.
30:13
Right. OK, now let's try to get.
30:21
The screen working. OK.
30:26
And should I think. There is no.
30:39
It should work now because the life is back. Is it working?
31:24
Let's take a look. Yeah, OK, it's working now, OK? All right.
31:44
So. Let me just delete the.
31:54
Any more questions? Is it well, you know, people on Zoom, can you see the screen?
32:09
Yes. All right, good. Would you please repeat again how the equation can be?
32:16
No solution. Repeat again, an example when there is a there are no solutions out there, right?
32:23
So the question is in which situation when you perform this, are you going to do the distortion elimination process,
32:32
then what would be what would it look like when there are no solutions to the system?
32:41
So that could be the example is something like. So if I start with the augmented matrix A.
32:49
And the work to be performed. Elementary, the operations.
33:00
OK, elementary rogue operations. To get a matrix, which looks like something like.
33:07
This OK. One one.
33:16
One zero zero zero. Zero everywhere again.
33:23
And let's say one, two, three four.
33:33
OK. This is just an example, suppose you end up.
33:38
Performing elemental operations to get an augmented matrix like this, then what does this say?
33:44
Look at the photo, the photo throw in place.
33:52
Zero times x one plus zero times x two plus zero times x three plus zero times x four.
34:00
Is equal to four. Is this possible?
34:12
Oh, no. That is an example of. No solution.
34:18
The system of linear equations has no solutions. Does that clarify your question?
34:26
Does that answer your question? Yeah. Good. Oh, sorry.
34:33
I just ask the question just regarding the solution. I just have just provide a way you can look back about this problem of box.
34:37
Yeah. So why is it zero x one four zero two four zero three zero zero export instead of zero x plus zero?
34:47
Why is that? Yeah, it's the same thing. Why do we have all variables?
34:55
These are three levels it applies. I've taken an example where any was four, but it can.
35:00
It applies for any and equals one two three four five. It doesn't matter.
35:08
But on the case. But but taking the case on our left, there are three variables.
35:13
Let me see. Oh, yes, you are right. So in this example, there is no, you're right.
35:23
Yes, so you should not be x y z or close to us, yeah, yeah, you're right.
35:30
So I just made a small dimensional mistake. I assumed it was three initially, but I ended up writing for any place for look for unknown variables.
35:37
Yeah. Thank you. Okay.
35:50
This story also filled up with that will mean that the one, two, three and not four.
35:57
It applies for any and I just gave an example where n equals three.
36:03
But it it applies for any number of unknown unknowns.
36:08
Yes. With if you just basically basically let let me simplify this, if you can perform raw operations to get an equation which looks like.
36:18
Summation of. I from one.
36:33
To end. Zero times X.
36:42
I. Equals some land, which is not equal to zero.
36:47
If you can perform elementary operations on the system or on the set of linear
36:57
equations that are there in the system to get an equation which looks like this.
37:03
But. OK, then that's a contradiction.
37:09
That means there is no solution. OK, thank you.
37:14
Yeah. Would there be no solutions or infinite solutions?
37:19
That would mean no solution for any finite solution.
37:25
Again, again, these are concepts which you soon study when we cover rank and rank of a matrix and dimension of no space and those concepts.
37:31
But yeah, for infinite building many solutions you'll get.
37:43
You should get. You should be able to reduce the number of equations to be less than the number of variables,
37:51
if you can do that than you'll get in front of demonstrations. OK.
38:00
Again, I think now more questions on abortion elimination, but you should ask you, does they will be able to guide you with examples?
38:09
OK. All right. Do I have time?
38:20
All right, only 10 minutes left. OK, let let me develop an intuition about those anyway, ratings we continue, Rick doesn't make is again on Wednesday.
38:27
But let me help you develop an intuition of. ofThe matrix multiplication.
38:41
OK. So first. So far, what we have done, we started with the fundamental problem of linear algebra,
38:51
which is to solve a system of linear equations when you make it compact.
39:01
You get these rectangle objects.
39:05
This thing is called The Matrix. This is a matrix.
39:10
And these are vectors. OK.
39:19
As computer scientists, as mathematicians, you should think of,
39:26
because as a collection of an ordered collection of numbers and order, seek ordered sequence of no order a set of numbers.
39:29
OK. And make interpretation of object.
39:38
That would be that it is a point then and in dimensional space.
39:42
So over your x is a.
39:46
X, though, Victor X. Would be some point.
39:55
In an end, dimensional Euclidean space and Vector B is some point.
40:00
In an m dimensional Euclidean space. Well, another way to understand a vector.
40:09
And this will this will prove useful later on is I can write.
40:18
X1. Xin. As X one times one zero zero zero, no.
40:25
Plus, let me move this to the right.
40:36
Let me be OK once again. So a vector x x one dot dot dot x.
40:53
Any. Can also be written as X1 Times.
41:01
One zero. Zero, all the way, plus it's two times.
41:10
Zero one zero zero zero all the way. And so on.
41:18
Accent times zero zero. Zero and the last entries one way.
41:26
OK. We have a special name for. These vectors.
41:34
These reactors are the gold standard basis. OK.
41:41
That is one non-zero MP, which is one and zero everywhere else.
41:47
So standard basis. OK.
41:54
And I would like you to think of any Victor X, but to be some scalar in One Direction, one along One Direction and along one basis,
41:58
some others plus some other scalar along the other axis or another direction and so on.
42:13
OK. Now. In one of the.
42:20
In the in one of the lead in the Gaussian elimination, we do.
42:28
I I had said that you should think of a matrix as some kind of a function.
42:34
OK. When you apply a.
42:40
Eight X equals B A is some kind of a function.
42:45
Which takes the input. Victor, input, as they export or export or the Vector X is the input and your output is B so f defined from.
42:56
Odd in two, I am OK.
43:11
Think of a matrix. As a function, as a kind of function, which takes over as inputs and outputs of.
43:17
All right now. What about the increasingly?
43:27
What do they represent? Let me give an example, and then you will understand what the entries represent.
43:33
So suppose I consider them of a matrix.
43:46
One, two, three four five six.
43:52
OK. I'm interested in understanding what are these entities, what are these columns?
43:57
OK, tell me what would be. Eight times.
44:05
The victor. One zero. This is this is a standard basis.
44:15
This is one standard basis. What will this be?
44:22
Anyone? Yes. This will be.
44:31
One three fight. And what does this?
44:39
This is the first column of The Matrix eight.
44:47
Similarly, if you compute. A science.
44:55
01 the second standard basis or the other, the unique vector in the other axis in that.
45:07
What will that be? That will be two, four, six.
45:18
Which is. The second column. Of The Matrix eight.
45:27
So the Matrix eight is a function.
45:34
Which went wrong, which meant when you get a standard basis to it.
45:39
It gives you an output, which is one of the columns in The Matrix, it said.
45:48
So I want you to keep that in mind. And next time when I when we talk about matrix multiplication, yes,
45:54
you have studied matrix multiplication, the regular formula for it in high in high school.
46:02
And you might also see the same formula in the textbook in the lecture notes.
46:09
But I want you to focus on this intuition that you should think of a matrix as a function and that function.
46:17
Transforms the standard bases to its column. This week's columns.
46:28
OK. And next time when you see you see matrix multiplication radio multiplying two matrices,
46:34
you will have a different perspective about what what is actually happening in matrix multiplication.
46:40
So I think. I oh, I have a few minutes.
46:47
All right, let's let's just look at matrix multiplication. So I'll multiply two matrices.
46:55
OK, let's see a. Is.
47:09
One, two, three, four, five six.
47:16
And let's say another Matrix B.
47:22
Is. Seven eight.
47:31
Nine, 10. OK.
47:40
Now. Eight times be.
47:47
OK. Should be seen as.
47:58
Let's see, I'll also use the funds, Chen.
48:03
Notation, so think of it as some function F and think of B as some function G.
48:10
Now this can be your exercise, read eight times. Be.
48:20
Is the same as composition of two functions. Of G.
48:26
So and I should perhaps say it seems to be dying.
48:36
Of Victor eggs would be same as.
48:41
A composition of functions f of.
48:49
G of. X.
48:55
So next time we'll see this menu might apply to matrices.
49:08
You get another matrix, and that matrix represents the function, which is a composition of the original functions and.
49:13
OK. And I want you to keep this in mind when you do the matrix multiplication, when you look at the formula for matrix multiplication.
49:22
Once you understand that matrix multiplication is simply composition the functions, then all the properties of matrix multiplication like a b.
49:35
Inverse is equal to be in worse times in worse.
49:50
A plus, b, you know, there are many similar properties of of matrices,
49:57
and all that will make sense if you understand that matrices are nothing but some kind of functions.
50:05
OK? All right.
50:13
Any questions before I end the session?
50:17
Yes, I happy to function that night, except it's so so if there are so many and you look to me to see the left makes,
50:20
you should think of it as a function and the right matrix. You can think of it as a collection of vectors.
50:41
Right? OK. And then you can visualise this as the left function is operating on each column of the right matrix.
50:48
The result can get out of the way you get out and you get another matrix, which is a bit like, if you will, probably not yet.
51:00
So you can interpret it as the function and as a collection of excess. So they're basically merging both interpretation.
51:12
So for me, but yeah, OK, so the the question is, so for the people on Zoom,
51:19
the question is when you multiply two matrices and B, should we think of them as a as a function which states B as an input?
51:28
So there are two interpretations here the the matrix on the left e, you can think of it as a function and the matrix B on the right.
51:41
You can think of it as a collection of vectors. OK.
51:50
And then. You can think of matrix multiplication as operating on each of each of those
51:58
column vectors of B is as a function which operates on each column vector of B.
52:07
OK, will we discuss this in more detail on Wednesday?
52:14
There's one question in Jack. We.
52:19
OK, Ryan, I think we can discuss this question, and on Wednesday, it does an interesting question on which side will the inverse?
52:40
OK, we will discuss this on Wednesday. All right, thank you.
52:50
Thank you. First.
