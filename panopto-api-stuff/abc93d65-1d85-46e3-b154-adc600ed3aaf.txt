Title: 01 Overview
Category: Professional Issues
Lecturer: Thomas Lancaster
Date: 19/10/2021
Hello there, everyone.
0:01
Thomas Lancaster here and I just wanted to give you a bit of an overview about the professional issues strand of the first year computing lab,
0:03
which may come as a bit of a shock when you see this on your timetable with a bit of time set aside for you to do some preparation.
0:14
Well, the good news is that you don't need to worry about this too much in the early part of the year.
0:20
We're really building towards the end of the autumn term when the assessment for this takes place.
0:27
But there is some preparation to do for that.
0:33
And for me, it's quite important that you get involved with these kind of activities.
0:37
So I think I've made before I've met many of you because I'm a personal tutor and I have tutorials.
0:45
I'm the deputy senior tutor along with with Farrows at the moment, and Maria, who's currently on maternity leave as well.
0:51
I'm also the department stability officers have lots of roles involved with your programme.
1:00
Later years. I coordinate many of the projects you see, and quite a lot of the work we do on issues is building up for those later years.
1:06
It's building up for your employment as you really go forward to that stage.
1:13
But essentially in professional issues,
1:21
what we're thinking about is helping you to develop the wider skills you're going to need to succeed on the course.
1:23
And as an I.T. professional, this includes areas like thinking about getting an internship, think about getting a placement if you're on the Menge,
1:30
making sure you do the right project, making sure you build up the right portfolio for success in the future as well.
1:40
And it's one of these quite difficult areas when you're right at the very start of your course to
1:50
have to think about too much and the kind of things that I have regularly and I quite appreciate.
1:56
While you may say these are things like is this relevant? Should we be doing this?
2:04
All we want to do is sit in front of a computer programme. We want to do all the technical work and we're going to talk about ethics in this strand.
2:08
People say nobody cares about ethics in the real world. They just do what they want. None of this really matters.
2:16
Well, I want you to just try and put some of these preconceptions to one side for now and at least have a go at engaging with this type of material.
2:21
You might find your view does not change then.
2:31
But essentially at the time of recording this, I have just met many of my students who have returned from their third year placement.
2:36
And one of the comments I got was I wish we had thought more about how to prepare for the real world, about how to work in a company,
2:47
the differences in the culture of a company compared to working in a university setting,
2:56
some of the tricky situations that were going to come across there. I was asked to do things I didn't personally believe were right.
3:02
What should I do about it? And there is we touch on a little bit in in these recordings.
3:09
You don't really assess them. You also got a legal strand in the second year, which may help you with some of these areas as well.
3:14
But so much of this is about encouraging you to think about your own lifelong learning as well.
3:21
How do you make sure you have the skills you need for success in your job and your life and everybody?
3:26
This is different, but there is a certain ethical base we're going to work from.
3:32
There's a certain amount of professional requirements from the books, from the other professional bodies as well that we need to work from as well.
3:35
Just general expectations in the field.
3:44
And you might hear about things all the time about bias in artificial intelligence systems or not being able to
3:47
understand why certain decision was made and the things we should care about at these stages in our life and our career.
3:54
And some of this is about perception there, so I get involved with a lot of things that go on in the the wider world, not just at Imperial,
4:07
but beyond just a couple of examples at the time recording of things that have been involved with really in the last couple of weeks,
4:20
been part of a radio documentary on Radio four, delivered a keynote address for Four Island and for people involved academic integrity there,
4:27
which is really when you talk about research, which will come up in this module, is one thing that people are interested in.
4:37
You may notice that what I'm doing involved with external activity.
4:44
I try and make sure I am perceived in a certain way that so I will not always sit in front of you as I am right here,
4:48
wearing a a jacket, wearing a shirt, wearing a tie, when, well, I will nearly always wear a shirt when I talk and present.
5:02
But I very rarely wear a tie in a student situation.
5:10
But like so many people, if I'm in the office, I have ties in my drawer that I can put on if the right opportunity arises.
5:16
And you may think that you're going to work in a software house and everybody wears a t shirt and a hoodie, and that may or may not be true.
5:24
Certain companies have quite different expectations to others. And sometimes we don't want to oversee these type of things.
5:34
But you may go into situations where it helps to be able to dress to look the part.
5:41
I can't say that I am I don't I am an academic.
5:47
I'm not particularly fashion conscious or anything like that.
5:52
But other people may make much less of an effort than I do to to think about these kind of things.
5:56
And if you are to get to a certain level in the company,
6:06
then that will be a requirement that you perhaps dress in a certain way or perhaps that you follow the wider culture of that company,
6:09
that you just things that you can't avoid at that point that you have to be prepared for.
6:21
I've been through this. I moved into a more management role in higher education there and the institution I was at.
6:26
And the expectation was all the lecturing staff would wear a shirt and tie.
6:35
And that's very different to the expectation at Imperial, where people can dress very, very casually.
6:40
But there are still world renowned researchers and people are incredibly accomplished, known in their field.
6:46
So it all depends we dealing with. And let's say you're in an academic institution where you deal with external companies and they come in,
6:53
they want to drive business, then they they expect people to act in a certain way.
6:59
And maybe that is less of a concern at Imperial. So it is about thinking about the wider culture.
7:05
Now, these are things we may well come back to during the course of these sessions.
7:10
And you may be pleased to know that I will not be presenting them all dressed very smartly.
7:15
I may not even be on the screen for all of them.
7:21
I think it's nice for you to be able to put a face to a voice, just as I find when I'm speaking to people through that webcams.
7:23
But it's nice to know who I'm talking to at the other end because it makes such a difference there.
7:30
But what we're going to build towards. Are you spending the final week of term this week?
7:35
Eleven on a group assessment. And I just want you to take that on board.
7:39
That Group Eleven is going to be busy. It's going to be quite intensive to get this work done.
7:46
So please don't think about plotting your flights to take place during that week because you're going to find it
7:52
quite difficult to complete this work and even with the benefit to do many things remotely at the present time,
8:00
then you do need to put a bit of time in for all of this.
8:08
And I mentioned this now because it's unfortunate, I,
8:13
I know that the flight prices are going to be cheaper that week if you really have to leave early than planning for the previous weekend,
8:17
although I can't officially recommend that according to the imperial requirements about where you should be based at different points of the year.
8:25
But we know if you missed deadlines because you aren't going to fly to a travelling, you're quarantining this.
8:35
There's very little we can do if you've chosen to do that during the official imperial time, time.
8:42
And in fact, you'll find as you go through your programme that quite often the first and final weeks of term have quite a few things on
8:47
which aren't part of the main teaching and which you need to to plan for is certainly the case during your first year.
8:54
For that JAMESY students, I've also got a bit of maths, I think that still continues during that week, but we can work around that.
9:00
So in week 11, we will have some teaching sessions, we will have some support sessions primarily online,
9:06
although I do hope to be around in the building if you need me at different points,
9:13
but I can't easily broadcast from within the building to my my office environment.
9:17
It's all about the the wider constraints they operate under.
9:22
But the group assessment is going to be about you working on ethics.
9:27
It's going to be about you conducting some research, creating a video, and that's as a group.
9:31
And individually, you're going to be asked to do some academic writing.
9:37
And we have support in place for this to build up to that week and during the week itself.
9:40
And this is 10 percent of the marks for computing.
9:46
Practical one. Now, you may, on top of this,
9:50
have noticed that you need to get 50 percent to pass computing practical one as as compared to 40 percent for so many of your modules.
9:54
And so quite often, whether you participate in professional issues,
10:04
strand of the module or not will affect how well you do overall can definitely be the difference at the upper end between a mark of over 70,
10:08
a first class mark and lower mark. But it can be a difference between passing and not passing.
10:18
And to bear that in mind that there are a lot of Lexis tests or online time assessments associated with compute a practical one,
10:24
sometimes if you're a good programmer, you may have things that do not go the way you wanted on the day because that's how how tests are.
10:34
It can be a shock if you're used to getting very high marks and everything.
10:41
But when you're in a situation in a culture where many people used to getting very
10:45
high marks or ends up being a bit more differentiation between the marks there,
10:50
and as I say, it can be a shock to the system.
10:55
I've been through that myself as a student that but this 10 percent or some mark between zero and 10 can make a big difference to your overall grade.
10:58
And it is essentially is one degree classification is 10 percent. So please don't write this off as being something not particularly worth bothering
11:10
about or missing completely that we do have some support in place for you.
11:18
There will be some videos released now. I recorded videos last year.
11:23
When we're in a very similar situation, I my plan is to go through those videos.
11:28
There are some extra things I want to add.
11:34
There's updates I want to make and they will probably be a bit of a mix between things be available before and a new.
11:35
But these are these are deliberately short videos, the things you can put on when you have a bit of time and watch them in chunks
11:41
rather than feeling like you're sitting through a one hour prepared lecture there.
11:48
We also have videos about ethics, which I will come to separately to support this as well.
11:52
We have the Centre for Academic English. They help with academic writing, technical writing.
11:59
They're going to join us during the sessions in week eleven. But if you're not written in English before,
12:03
you might find it helpful to go to their website and look at some of the short courses they have available for you.
12:08
And we have our department's web and marketing officer, Ahmed Eitel.
12:15
He has got some support in place with creating videos because we're asking you to create a video rather than present live,
12:21
which allows you to use a different set of skills in your group.
12:27
Now, some of you will have created videos, be videos before. It may seem very easy.
12:31
Some of you may not have done, but hopefully you will have skills within your group to support you with this.
12:36
And I'll let you know how the groups are formed later on in the module.
12:42
So it's not something you have to worry about.
12:46
We've we have formed the groups for you here, but it may be something you want to think about and prepare for,
12:48
because one nice thing about you doing video creation and this will occur elsewhere in your course.
12:55
So this is almost a practise. But one nice thing about doing video creation as opposed to doing a live presentation,
13:01
is you have the opportunity to change and edit and take out all the problematic areas which you may notice are watching this video.
13:07
I have not done this is deliberately a one take video to introduce you to the
13:14
the concepts of professional issues and the activity in the module there.
13:19
But there are many situations where I will go and edit. I will change camera angles a lot more.
13:24
I may change the environment I present from.
13:28
I may demonstrate rather than talk there, all the things you can do to make your videos exciting and interesting there.
13:31
I'll introduce introduce to you Dr. Blix Whitby, who has been supporting us at Imperial with ethics teaching now for many years.
13:39
He was here is Blay in the video he produced last year. I think he is also planning to update some of these.
13:49
You may notice his carefully presented room.
13:54
You may try and read his books in the background. I have a good point, but the resolution to do that.
13:59
But again, it's the perception about.
14:04
Where you all I've got my green screen here behind me, so you can't see my messy bookcase that I'm working towards behind here,
14:06
but I could very well have whatever kind of background I wanted on the green screen that the biggest challenge I have tends to be glasses glare,
14:12
which is quite difficult to work with. But there are ways around that for for what I need to there.
14:20
But there is. Blay Play is a well-known ethicist. He's a computing person as well.
14:25
He's involved with advising the government about many things, doing ethics as well.
14:32
He will tell you more about other things. He's a member of the BCS.
14:37
He's involved with that policy to see is it really you supposed to know he's incredibly knowledgeable
14:41
about this area and getting you discussing the wider ethical concerns that are going on within the field.
14:46
And it's really valuable for us. So we've got play involved in your course from such an early part that I just thought a few of the support services,
14:53
hopefully you've covered a few of these with fires earlier in the year, too.
15:03
But things to think about the library. You've had a session, I think, with the library as well.
15:08
But areas like writing and avoiding plagiarism, because you will have to write during your course.
15:13
And one reason we ask you to write in this particular strand is so you don't suddenly go and find you have to write a 60 page,
15:18
finally a project report, and you've never done an academic writing. And it comes as a complete shock and you make very bad mistakes.
15:29
You should not be doing that. We've got the careers service, useful people to know.
15:35
Again, sessions like how to work in a group, the computing and industry trends going on alongside your your year as well.
15:41
We can talk you can see what different companies expectations are, what they're involved with.
15:51
Think about your role in the future docs as many great things as well, because the docs,
15:56
like students, have been through the process of applying for internships and placements.
16:02
They put on extra things that aren't in your course.
16:06
That can't be that we can't fit in and you get to learn from other students, which is incredibly useful, a big part of my my want to work as well.
16:07
You've had the unconscious bias training with Jackie as well as an active bystander.
16:15
Coming up, we sometimes run another workshop in the second term as well to support all of these.
16:20
But what I'm really saying is do take advantage of the useful sessions going on around Imperial as well.
16:26
There are even things going on outside Imperial.
16:35
I just close with an example which was sent to me today, and it's quite timely about a news story released by by Oxford up on their website.
16:39
And here is the headline they have with the story.
16:52
Vaccinated groups at highest risk of covid-19 hospitalisation and deaths identified using new Q covid tool.
16:56
Now, it is a few weeks old at the time record, and I haven't seen this one before.
17:03
But what is your perception? Let's use that word again. When you see this headline, what does this make you think of?
17:08
How might this be misused in this era of fake news and worrying about the accuracy and correctness of research?
17:16
And one thing that was was pointed out to me and which I would also think about this is
17:23
could you see an implication here that if you get a vaccine or if you get vaccinated,
17:29
let's use a bit of slightly more correct English.
17:36
The if you get vaccinated, does that mean you are now at greater risk of being hospitalised and greater risk of dying then if you are not vaccinated?
17:38
And this is all to do with how we use our words and language and how things can be misinterpreted or taken out of context there.
17:51
And so this could be misused by people to spread fake news or to encourage people to not take a vaccine.
17:59
And let's put aside any personal opinions you might have about that.
18:06
But going from the scientific evidence, which suggests that this is a a good idea and clearly Imperial,
18:11
which is very much involved with the the drive towards vaccines and safety around covid, then.
18:17
So this is something that should never have been published using this headline.
18:24
If you read the the article, then they will say something slightly different,
18:30
that it will say that if you have been vaccinated and you were in particularly groups, you have greater risk.
18:35
And it probably suggests that these are precautions you could take. We just look at the raw headline.
18:41
You take that out of context.
18:45
You don't read the article as so many people don't because they are not interested in the the details, then you could be very badly advised.
18:46
That's one reason why I have to be so careful with our wording in our in research,
18:53
in emails and how we write it, how we use social media and how we present.
19:00
So that's why another reason we're getting you involved and thinking about language and technical writing at this early stage.
19:07
So this is just provided you a little bit of a flavour about what will happen in professional issues.
19:14
You've got that time set aside in the final week of term. Then it is quite an enjoyable activity.
19:18
You get to investigate an ethical case and conduct some research in a way that you don't
19:25
get that many opportunities to do this kind of thing during the course of the year,
19:29
because a lot of it is technical. And having these other skills to add Chipo are incredibly important as well.
19:32
As I mentioned, there will be other videos to watch, but please don't worry about these.
19:39
These are going to be more towards the second half of the term.
19:42
So feel free to ask questions on Ed, but we will follow up later on.
19:46
And I do hope you enjoy the professional issues strand of the module.
19:50
