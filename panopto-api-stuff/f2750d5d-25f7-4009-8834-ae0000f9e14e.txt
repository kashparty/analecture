Title: Ethics Q&A - 16 December 2021
Category: Ethics
Lecturer: Thomas Lancaster
Date: 16/12/2021
Technologies, I really like The View on Thursday, 16th of December.
0:00
In the afternoon, so it's at the stage now in your project that it is finishing off the last questions things we can help with.
0:07
It's not really where we're going to tell you all that much, which is new because I suspect by this point you will have,
0:18
at the very least, have your video planned out, hopefully will have some of it recorded and ready to be edited together.
0:27
So you've still left yourself enough time to do all the last minute checks and the uploads tomorrow
0:35
remembering we're expecting most people probably just uploaded to YouTube and then give us a link to YouTube.
0:41
It can be an unlisted video on YouTube,
0:47
so it doesn't have to be visible to all and sundry who randomly find you through the search engines, but that is where we're at.
0:50
We added another short video yesterday, looking at ethical frameworks and a few hints.
1:00
I think it was only eight minutes long,
1:06
and I think it's probably only six minutes long because we had a little bit of time while we set up virtual backgrounds and things like that.
1:07
So but it wasn't worth editing it because I wanted to get that up for you.
1:16
So there's just some links on there, but essentially the links are the same ones that we put up on the ad anyway for you to look
1:22
at and they may or may not be useful and may or may not be relevant for what you're doing.
1:30
We just wanted to make sure that information was out there. So really opportunity for questions, ideas, thoughts.
1:33
There is one question we have in the chat, which is can we go over 15 minutes?
1:42
And the answer really is no, because we because these are these the limits are there for a reason.
1:48
And so if you said 50 minutes, please stick to 15 minutes with that.
1:56
Officially, we can stop watching it 50 minutes. I suspect if we go 60 minutes and five seconds, nobody is going to worry.
2:03
But your best normally not to chance that.
2:08
And if you find that happening, there often are easy things to do to edit the video.
2:12
Like just take out the pause here and there.
2:16
Yeah, every time I say, Oh, if I was going to go back and edit it, then you could save a few seconds for that.
2:21
You can also do things if you're really desperate,
2:28
like just very fractionally speed up the recording at certain times, and people normally won't watch it.
2:31
And you might notice this kind of thing now happens on TV if you ever go back and watch some,
2:38
some channels where they play old programmes that used to be 30 minutes long,
2:44
and now somehow it's 30 minutes long, but with more adverts in,
2:47
then they either tend to get around that by cutting out some of the controversial things you can't say anymore.
2:51
But quite often they just do this very slight speeding up of the content at different points where people don't notice for that.
2:58
It's just one of these odd editing tricks. So that's another way you could do that,
3:05
and sometimes it can be just as quick to slightly rerecord something and express it differently or speak slightly faster.
3:09
You have the one benefit which doesn't happen in a real life talk, which is the benefit of being able to edit.
3:21
And I'll give you an example of last Monday.
3:28
I have my academic integrity in a STEM module, which is I explore it's one you'll be able to choose in your third year.
3:32
Is yours outside of computing option, even though I am from computing,
3:39
but essentially it's available to everyone and we run a conference for the groups have been working on research projects to present over Zoom,
3:43
and we had an external audience as well who are joining us, which was quite nice for that one.
3:51
And I remember one of the talks was really, really great.
3:56
Interesting talk. But the third person in the group just talked slowly and overdid it and took much more time than they had.
3:59
So the final person in the group really just had to talk very fast or skip a lot of things.
4:09
And yes, you can get around it, but it's not great.
4:14
It's quite a poor impression. So use the benefits of being able to go back and refine and edit for that there.
4:20
And if somebody has in the group,
4:26
should do three minutes and have five minutes and maybe have to go back to that person and ask them to to rethink it.
4:29
So we have a question for the research citations, part of the summary structure given to us on Blackboard.
4:38
I'm a bit confused on what we do here. Do we list all references at the end separately after the summary?
4:43
Well, these bits are all being marked and assessed by the Centre for Academic English.
4:52
This is their framework they've put together with how to develop and.
4:57
And that's why they put the resources up for you on Blackboard to help you out with that.
5:00
But I will say just as a general point, then the reference is always to the summary because that's just before might look an academic paper.
5:06
You look in a document that's where the references fit in that structure.
5:15
You're not expected to have a huge number of references for a summary, but if you have them, maybe you've got two references.
5:20
Maybe you've got four references there then.
5:27
Yet you have the summary and then we are quite happy with the references going on to a a second page as well.
5:30
If you need to do for that there, remember as well the two bits of referencing.
5:35
You've got the Vancouver format we use.
5:41
You put the number in the text itself, so you write a statement and then you attribute the source, which might be one in the brackets.
5:44
And then the reference list at the end is the the full details of where that source comes from.
5:53
So in the reference section, you put one and then the full list. So what is the name of the paper, the journal, the publication date.
6:00
The issue number the authors, all in the appropriate order for that.
6:07
So that's that. Yeah, so that really is the the way referencing works there, and I'm sure if you get it completely wrong,
6:12
then they will give you some feedback from the certificate of English as well.
6:23
But. That a yeah, that's centuries, is it?
6:27
And I guess what they're also asking in terms of their marking criteria is they want to know that you have used references.
6:33
And you as appropriate to back up the point you made for that one.
6:45
Yeah, yeah. So it's a question or comment.
6:50
So we would have the summary and a separate reference list on a separate page.
6:55
They may all sit on one page so you don't feel you have to go over two pages.
7:01
But if you need a, the summary itself should only be on one page because it's meant to be short.
7:05
But if you need to go on to a second page with references, that's fine.
7:12
And then there are just little things to do with layout that I don't like to put a reference list where
7:17
I have one reference or one line of a reference on the first page and then the rest on the second page.
7:24
So I will almost always manually insert a page break there and just put all the references
7:29
on the the second page if that is going to be the case because it just looks neater.
7:34
I suppose, to include only the references mentioned in the summary or all the ones in the video that a reference should be referred to in the text,
7:41
so only references only source as you refer to in the summary, should be in the reference list at the end of the of the the short document ending in.
7:51
Yeah, there is a there is.
8:01
There is also a style of writing a list of sources known as a bibliography and sometimes a reference list in the bibliography gets confused.
8:06
But officially speaking, a reference list is just sources you have directly used.
8:16
A bibliography might also include some, some from of reading or other sources you used or the sources you read, but not directly cited.
8:20
So there is a difference between a reference list and bibliography. A lot of people just use those terms interchangeably for that, but for this one,
8:30
we just want the reference lists are just the direct sources you've used in the the summary in your
8:37
presentation that may be more sources will almost certainly will be more sources than you put in a summary.
8:43
For the slides is to correct the references are made at the bottom of each slide.
8:52
Yes, my strong recommendation for you for about the 10th time this week, we had this discussion,
8:59
but don't worry, there is that you put the reference on the same slide.
9:08
And just to make the reason really clear, it's because when we are watching your videos or wasn't watching a live presentation,
9:14
we can't suddenly flick forward to the end of your presentation to find out what the sources.
9:22
So if you just put a number there, then we have no clue where you've got that information from,
9:27
whether the whether your source is the Sun or whether your source is a highly reputable academic paper.
9:30
We don't know. So that's why we like the the source on the slide.
9:37
It doesn't necessarily have to be in the future. I find the footage of a convenient place to put them so inconsistent.
9:42
But some people might use a different layout for their slides so that if the same references used to relate to Slide,
9:48
can you just reference the relevant number without the full citation again?
9:55
I think that's fine. Myeni.
9:59
Proviso with that one is if you have a large number of sources, then people, when you're tense lives on may forget which source was which.
10:04
So it can just be easier to put the source on the slide again and keep that consistent layout.
10:13
But I'll let you separate judgements of that one, depending what makes your slice of presentation look really deep.
10:19
And if a slide uses only one source of all information on that slide, can we just list the full reference at the bottom of that slide?
10:26
Yes, I guess so. But still be consistent and give it a number for that source and put the reference at the bottom link to that number.
10:37
Yeah, that's how we do. I would do referencing and it's just practise.
10:48
You will you'll get there. Run your slides past the other members of the group before you record them, if you're planning to do things separately,
10:55
so you can make sure all consistent because especially if two people use the same source, you don't want to then number it twice in different ways.
11:05
A double underline that if one of your group members is going to present,
11:13
having not seen all the slides, the chances of things going wrong is very, very great.
11:19
You should coordinate. See the full presentation.
11:24
Yeah, it's the consistency as much as any as far as everything,
11:31
it looks really strange if one person has a certain slight layout and then the next person just slightly out.
11:37
It will happen. They'll be at least one who will do that, but it looks really good when we come to look at it.
11:43
Should we start our references from one on each side or should we continue for the last number used on the previous slide?
11:50
I suggest you continue for the last number used on the previous slide.
11:56
Yeah. And if it happens that you, you do reference source one two three four and then use one of the previous sources again, source one.
12:00
You go back to the no source one there, then perhaps go to source five.
12:11
So the only need to give, no matter how many times you use the same source, it only has one number.
12:15
Can you include rhetorical questions? Yeah, I don't see why not? Yes.
12:27
Yeah, these are essentially sinking points. In a way where we're asking you to we're saying, how could it have been done differently?
12:36
So that's a rhetorical question. I'm just hoping you'll give good structured answers to that one.
12:47
Well, it's answering the question I ask. Not really rhetorical. Yes.
12:55
Yeah, no. But yeah, I was thinking I was thinking points for the audience or opportunities for reflection or something like that.
13:00
Because this is the one of the things about ethics of it.
13:11
I mean, clearly there are some things that are right or wrong,
13:15
but but so many things are down to a certain amount of personal and a different viewpoints.
13:18
Yes. So as we've said earlier in the week, this is not great for everyone who wants to right or wrong answer for everything.
13:26
Well, there's a handy quote, though, I don't know that I could give you a reference for it, but I believe it's from Philip,
13:36
a poet and Philip was the philosopher who first sent that runaway tram or trolley first published that thought experiment.
13:43
And she says the fact to Twilight does not entail, but there is no difference between night and day.
13:52
So it's what Thomas says. Some things are definitely right, and some things are definitely wrong,
13:59
but there is a twilight light shade over into each other, and that's where ethics can get particularly difficult.
14:05
Sorry. Oh, that's fine. I'm just going to refrain from random quotes at this point, so don't worry.
14:15
So, yes, I hope everything is is going well.
14:28
I'm not going to sit here and try and fill for too long, sir, for this because of the stage we're at with just over 24 hours to go,
14:31
it's not really starting again by time, but I'm hoping everything is going smoothly in your group.
14:40
It's our own issues that need addressing. Please let us know. You're also asked to fill out the peer review information.
14:47
It should all be visible to you now, but it's probably something to fill in tomorrow,
14:56
just in case somebody disappears in the in the last 24 hours or something like that.
14:59
There. But most of the time you all get the same mark in your group.
15:05
But we do have that option to various individual markets as may happen for that one.
15:11
Where do you submit to peer review?
15:21
You go on to the peer review system or peer assessment system, I will put the link in the chat just so you can just make sure it shows for you.
15:22
Peer Hyphen Assessment Dot Dot Dot Dot Dot UK there now, I believe it may not show you anything to use.
15:34
I'm not sure because of how it's set up in my show to me, but the student should be able to get on.
15:43
It should show the people who are meant to be in that group.
15:49
I should be able to score them between one and five, or possibly 0.5, of which three is expected.
15:51
Standard virtual background question If you have a virtual background while you're speaking in the video and it's not posted anywhere public.
16:01
Are we allowed to use an image which may be copyrighted as a background?
16:07
Also, are we allowed to use a small audio file as the introduction to the presentation?
16:12
So we had quite a long discussion yesterday about images and copyright and what really you can do and you can't do.
16:17
So I'd encourage you to have a look about there.
16:27
And if you don't want to watch the whole things and that they also generate a transcript that you can flick through,
16:30
it may not be perfect to the presentation.
16:35
Yeah, go ahead. This morning, I posted a URL to a site at your university that goes into quite a lot of detail on copyright and fair use of images.
16:38
It's a it's a really complex issue,
16:52
but I'm not really going to apologise for that because it's something you'd have to confront sooner or later in your career,
16:55
so you might as well confront it now. And it's part of being professional.
17:02
And it's kind of like ethics in a way because some things stealing someone's art using a company's logo.
17:10
You know, these are obviously things that that might be wrong.
17:18
But if you can claim academic values and cite where you got it from, then that's probably okay.
17:23
But that's as much as I'm going to say it's a complex issue.
17:30
Oh, well, the other thing I would say is your your government and every European government is looking to change the rules on this.
17:34
So don't expect it to remain the same throughout your career.
17:41
But just at the moment, it's really very difficult. Sorry.
17:45
Oh, that's absolutely fine. Yeah. So can can you use a copyrighted image in the in your virtual background?
17:51
There. You best not to do your best, try and find a royalty free image or to take your own photo if it's appropriate.
18:00
If you were to use a copyrighted image, it was hidden away in the background.
18:14
Then we may or may. We probably won't notice and go and hunt for the source of these images because we're
18:18
going to assume you've done your own due diligence before posting things for that.
18:24
It's relatively minor in the transgressions type. Issues you might come across for this, but officially speaking, you shouldn't.
18:30
Are you allowed to use a small audio file as the introduction to the presentation? I mean, you're allowed to use audio in your presentation.
18:42
That is not a problem that can really add to a video. Are you allowed to use somebody's copyrighted audio there than academic fair use?
18:49
You probably can use a small amounts of it without too much difficulty, just the same way as if, say, you are.
19:01
I just don't think it's like photocopying laws, then you can photocopy one chapter of a book, you can't photocopy a whole book.
19:11
I believe that is the rule or something very similar. They have things like, I listen to the radio,
19:17
they have things like beat the intro type competitions on quite a lot of radio stations where you hear an intro.
19:24
We don't hear the whole song, and that was all to do with the rules for royalties.
19:31
And if you listen to a very short fragment of a song and the intro, then there are no royalties to pay.
19:35
So there's a certain amount of stuff you can do, but try and.
19:41
And then there are people as well who try to get away with reusing audio in terms of sampling for other musical tracks.
19:46
And so there's a certain amount of stuff you can do, but I would just treat this with with care for that one.
19:54
There's a question I just came to me privately is referencing images referencing the music, using Vancouver, referencing, I think that's OK.
20:02
That may be overkill for images, but you can't go too far wrong there.
20:10
And for one of them is a Shutterstock. Shutterstock image and it's just references.
20:14
Shutterstock This.
20:20
Shutterstock, I believe is a paid service isn't where you where you pay to get the use of their stock photography.
20:24
So if you've paid for it, then it's absolutely fine. And I think they do have some royalty free photos that may have some free ones.
20:33
I'm just looking at their sites in the background there. And if it's really necessary, have to reference it.
20:40
If it's something you've got the legal right to use like that, it can't hurt, but it's not necessary.
20:47
It's only a few sort of stealing it from them, and it's mostly because they will come after you.
20:54
If ever find this online and ask you for an exorbitant price for something they think you should have paid for.
20:59
Because despite what many people will think, the information isn't free and pictures on free,
21:05
at least from the ethical viewpoint of the people who have done the work to take those photos or to compile that information.
21:11
Where where do you smear the peer review, the peer review?
21:18
I've done that one signal that and where do you submit the summaries on Blackboard and where do you submit the other bits?
21:22
Kate, can you use pictures for Google? As long as you source where it's from is another part of yesterday's discussion.
21:28
Real royalty free pictures are fine going on to some.
21:35
These random web page and stealing their photos is not normally a good idea because they may own those photos for that one.
21:38
I know the one has just come to me.
21:48
I have a bullet point in a slide and I talk a bit more about the bullet point in the presentation with info that isn't on the slides.
21:50
How do I sign information that I refer to when I'm talking, but that isn't referred to on the slide itself?
21:57
Is it OK to just add the citation to the bullet point on the slide?
22:03
Well, you so you need you need a citation on the slide, certainly, and you need the.
22:12
And the citation has to match the text. You shouldn't have a citation and text that do not match each other.
22:22
So I think really the only way to get around this one would be to I thought it was
22:29
a very short additional point on the slide with the with the appropriate citation,
22:33
which you then talk about more verbally.
22:39
Or perhaps another way you might do this is to say is to add an additional information section with a citation and try and cover it that way.
22:42
So a statement like additional information referred to verbally is from source to be ugly.
22:54
I think that would that would work or if you just got too much information for one slide that maybe these two slides.
23:03
OK, they're all coming to me, me privately, so hopefully you're getting some private ones play as well to keep you busy.
23:14
I'm not getting it right. I'm OK trying to get people from the sequel to try, but it's like, Yeah, people, people don't necessarily want the name.
23:20
They're so embarrassing. Yeah, they're not embarrassing questions any of these.
23:29
So don't worry about that. But anyway, the next one without naming the student if a screenshot public social media post, we need to cite each one.
23:33
For example, in my group's presentation with a screenshot of search results on a social media platform.
23:42
Would we need to cite each post in the search results? I think that's overkill to try and site every post.
23:47
If you've got a lot of them together, I would probably just cite the platform as a whole in that case.
23:54
But it's a little bit of an art for most of the time to social media posts,
24:00
public and people can just search for the post and find it again quite easily for that app.
24:05
Things I might do sometimes will be a reference date in those just in case people go and delete the posts in the future, but it's not too crucial.
24:12
Somebody something else like wants to do on slides is I put a series of news headlines or something like that,
24:23
and I wouldn't necessarily put a citation for each news story,
24:28
but I would put the possibly put the name of the newspaper or something like that
24:33
on the date it was published so people could go away and find that for themselves.
24:37
Often you see that in a screenshot anyway. So we can, I think I say we must be concerned with you complying with the with the spirit of the.
24:41
Of referencing here and trying to acknowledge sources of information,
24:54
we were not going to be too concerned if your reference is slightly wrong format at this stage, but that.
24:59
So long as you've you've tried to comply with the rules, then.
25:11
If it was a written document and this will apply when you do your your document, the means you, yes,
25:16
they will look at the the references and a bit more detail to just check the format of them and then your
25:21
future written work like your final year project or your third year group project or anything with references.
25:29
Again, people look at that a bit more detail.
25:34
But when watching this in the form of video and everything goes past quite quickly, we don't necessarily check things quite so closely.
25:37
That's just the realest part of me speaking. And.
25:45
So any of the any other thoughts?
25:52
For the day, I get lots of ideas about things that I need to address for next year that come up as questions again and again.
25:56
But yeah. Image images and even sound citation is quite a difficult area to cover the sound one is not what I have been asked regularly,
26:13
so that is a nice new question.
26:23
Because you can't plagiarise, Sandy, just before you came in or as you came in, L.A. was talking about plagiarised music.
26:27
So it does. Does it very much happen?
26:33
And if you had to choose a very similar to to one another, what is it?
26:36
Inspiration and quite acceptable. And when is it plagiarism?
26:42
So many interesting areas here to think about.
26:46
And then there's a whole area combining both of those when they got to video clips,
26:52
but I won't go into that one because I as a rabbit hole will go down.
26:55
Yes, you are so inspired by by play here, with the books carefully arranged in the background at the very small dress and everything,
27:03
and you set up your room to look exactly like that for the video to impress him.
27:12
What is that inspiration or is that copying? I was once told by a wise to up long, long ago, probably in a about the time was my first book.
27:16
There's no copyright on the truth, so all you have to do is replace an idea.
27:34
The ethical the what's unethical is simply stealing someone else's work, so putting your name to someone else's work or just stealing it?
27:45
That's what's unethical. Learning from it, that's that's a very, very good idea.
27:55
In practise, I can give you another high scoring setting,
28:01
which is learnt from the mistakes of others because you won't live long enough to make all of them for yourself.
28:03
Yeah. Very good yet. And you'd be surprised how many I'm just thinking of this, how many people you don't do it, I know,
28:12
but how many people have a very carefully arranged bookcase behind them when they when they
28:19
go and they do a presentation or they do a they do a media interview or something like that,
28:24
and they have exactly the books. They want people to see there and they get the zoom exactly right.
28:30
And often they have the you don't do it always, but they have the if they've written a book,
28:38
they have that carefully, the backgrounds of people going to buy it and things like that.
28:43
And I have my friend, Zainab Khan in the UAE who academic integrity field, who has written a children's book,
28:48
and she always has that book very carefully props up on the shelf because people write all kinds of she's a computer scientist that yeah,
28:56
yeah, it's harder than you might think because you actually get a bit of reflection on that.
29:07
So you can't quite read it. It's in a shiny cover.
29:11
I can't really target because it's in Chinese, but it's definitely by me.
29:15
Right? Oh, is your skill I didn't know you had was was. I'm speaking Chinese, so let's say I didn't translate that right?
29:20
So I assume I know what it says. But yeah,
29:30
but if but presumably this is an official translation and not what does happen with textbooks is unofficial stolen translations into other languages.
29:35
I can only give them away to people who can read Mandarin. Not very many people have swung by.
29:45
So if anybody wants a copy in Chinese, we have a few people, a few people who I'm sure read Mandarin on the module and some of them with us today,
29:51
but hard to tell from people's names because it doesn't mean everyone speaks Mandarin.
30:04
Whether that. Yeah.
30:12
Well, I can read English spirit. I saw what artificial intelligence at the top.
30:17
So that is. I wouldn't request not really sure why the publishers gave them to me.
30:21
It's nice to know. Or Brazilian Portuguese again, which I can't I can just about translate.
30:30
That's even though I don't speak Portuguese and work out what it says.
30:41
It was interesting that it becomes easy and not only.
30:45
Well, yes, some languages put the adjective after the noun as a habit.
30:51
French does that. Yeah. Anyway, we have a question about the formality of the presentation.
30:58
Essentially, it's the style of presentation meant to be like if it was a lecture given by a lecturer,
31:06
I ask, this is sometimes lecturers might become slightly informal to have better pupil engagement.
31:12
Well, I mean, my quick answer that is many lecture lectures are so incredibly boring.
31:16
This must be for you not to present in that style. That is my view.
31:23
The whole idea about doing a video is you can try and engage people in different ways.
31:28
Now, how informal you want to go is a bit of a judgement call for that one.
31:34
If you if you when you say you informal, you mean you want to be like one of these trendy lecturers who decides they want to swear during the lecture,
31:41
then for me, that is not the route to go down.
31:47
So, yeah, well, we have some of those in the department.
31:50
Definitely.
31:55
If you want to make the odd joke and you think that jokes other people will find funny and won't be misinterpreted, you get away with that.
31:59
It's it is very difficult to predict how people react to jokes when you have a international multicultural audience,
32:07
though, and if it's informal in that you,
32:16
you're going to show some some pictures or you going to show a video clip or something like that to increase engagement
32:22
as absolutely fine and probably encouraged because this is why you're doing edited video as opposed to a live talk.
32:29
But you had to replicate in the real world if you were to go into a presentation to replicate an academic lecture,
32:40
then it doesn't tend to be that well received. And even if I go into an academic talk outside of the conference,
32:45
I try and make it a bit more interesting than just a dry lecture as well and try and use lots of examples and try and make it interactive,
32:52
which you can't make it interactive when it's a recorded video or easily.
33:00
But there are different options there. Should we include a diagram of our ethical decisions?
33:05
Or is this fish sufficient to just state our points in reasoning?
33:12
I think whatever works best for your particular topic. Really?
33:18
But as you are doing a visual presentation of the videos and diagrams or images often help.
33:23
Just your standard 10 slides with five bullet points, but slides gets quite boring quite quickly.
33:31
So it doesn't mean necessarily a diagram works perfectly in every situation, but diagrams can often be valuable.
33:39
Yeah. It's kind of up to you, but but I think, you know,
33:48
given that I'm talking to an audience of computer scientists or about to become computer scientists,
33:55
that very often the structured diagram helps you and helps you nail down what can seem to be a bit of a costly subject.
34:02
I mean, it isn't really the decision.
34:13
Tree help show that it's actually quite structured, but that's all.
34:17
I mean, if if you don't want a diagram of your decision making, then then that's fine.
34:24
I'm not going to insist on it. But I do think it helps, particularly in a in a very techie scenario.
34:29
Yeah, very true. So we've been fully finding with these answers is we're leaving a lot of the decisions to you because there isn't
34:41
a perfect format for presentations that fits every possible subject and which fits the strengths in each group,
34:51
but how people want to work. So we are encouraging it to be creative for this as well.
35:00
So that is absolutely fine. There you might think it's your first presentation at university.
35:05
You should be being very traditional, but actually we I don't think either of us are worried about this being really traditional.
35:11
You will have the opportunity there, the style of presentations during your course at different times, but with old fashioned view.
35:18
Now, if you go to it for a job interview and they asked you to prepare a presentation as they sometimes do, particularly for academic jobs,
35:24
other jobs as well, and doesn't need to be the same as everyone else's presentation, no one remembers you.
35:32
If that's all you do, you have to be able to be slightly different with these things there.
35:37
So I mean, let's. Let's let's take place sorry for picking any blame,
35:45
but the the fact that you make an effort and dress up for presentations means that people will then be here for that.
35:51
And the fact that you back up everything because you know what you're talking about obviously
35:58
helps as well that so it's what what would you do to make yourself memorable as well?
36:01
I actually feel it's disrespectful to your audience to to wear scruffy clothes.
36:08
It's kind of telling your audience you don't care about them, but just a personal view.
36:14
You don't have to agree. But but what I would strongly say is in COVID and post-COVID recruitments,
36:19
what we're asking you to do make a short video is probably crucial in job applications and making context and getting promotions.
36:28
So this is not a purely a social fun skill we're talking about here.
36:38
It's an important work skill evening. Very techie computing jokes.
36:44
Yeah. Well, you've got me thinking talking to camera is a skill and showing your face is something that companies expect now.
36:50
We're expecting the same for this module, but I don't need to do it for a session like this.
37:02
So much so it is nice to see some people and know we have an audience there who is interested and have an idea how you react.
37:08
But a nice thing about this to me is because there are two of us play and I could bounce off each other a bit so we can see the chat.
37:15
But when it's a one person lecturing to a virtual room, it's not quite the same as doing that.
37:21
But the other thing you'll come across and may already have done this if you're planning internships this
37:28
year is the companies that now have essentially pre-recorded interviews or asynchronous interviews.
37:33
And what I mean by that is they will tell you to log on to a system a certain time,
37:42
and you'll be asked to interview a question by one of the robots or one of the pre-recorded voices.
37:47
The other end, and then you'll get a few seconds to think about it, and then your camera will turn on you.
37:52
You'll get one take to give your answer to the interview question and then it gets repeated,
37:56
and that one is difficult if you struggle with that kind of thing.
38:02
Do you use the services from careers to help you to practise and prepare?
38:05
But I would try and get involved with some of those because they are incredibly tricky.
38:10
Some of these questions will be there to throw you, even if you've prepared things, and then the companies will go.
38:15
You'll spend all this time doing this. The companies will choose whether to take your application forward to, let's say,
38:21
a real interview from that or even nowadays that may transcribe your answers and just decide whether to go
38:27
forward based on the the transcriptions or some artificial intelligence used to to check what you've said,
38:34
whether it's ethical or not, is a is another question, but those kind of things happen in the the cutthroat world of recruitment.
38:41
Luckily for you, as I'm sure you said before, you'll have no problem getting jobs at the end because there is a shortage of people in this field.
38:49
But sometimes the internships along the way are a bit tougher to get for that.
38:55
How close are you to stick to the question if you see an opportunity for good content not directly related,
39:02
the question will you be rewarded for including it?
39:07
Well, we expect you to stick to the general area and whether it's the ethical case or ethical topic,
39:12
but you may bring in wider context that's perfectly normal. You may bring in related examples to strengthen your discussion.
39:19
That is absolutely fine, but it's the answer that Blaze's has put is possibly or it depends, which is which is very true.
39:26
It shouldn't be that you're doing a 15 minute video,
39:37
and only five minutes is on your area and 10 minutes and other things up be completely wrong balance.
39:41
So but it may be more the other way around 10 minutes on your main area and five minutes of of wider context to bring your ideas in.
39:47
These clips of videos, as long as you reference them in your presentation,
39:56
I'm going to refer you to my earlier discussions about images and sound and say essentially
40:01
the same rules apply for using clips of copyrighted material in the form of videos.
40:09
Generally, you'll get away with it for a very short clip without too many issues.
40:18
But anything that's publicly on YouTube, and they have algorithms that run through and try and find copyrighted material now,
40:27
and they will either do things like if it's a music video that might just get rid of all the sound from the video,
40:35
or they might delete the video, or they might block your account.
40:42
I was at a virtual conference about just over a year ago, and there was a presentation from a group of people and I was, I think, I think in Mexico.
40:47
And at the end of the presentation, they played a clip from the the local version of of Dragon's Den, which was designed to illustrate that point.
41:02
And suddenly they got loads of people watching this.
41:12
And suddenly this live feed, which is running through YouTube, was pulled because this was copyrighted material if there was a different language.
41:15
So these things will are difficult there.
41:25
I mean, clearly, places do do this and they do. They do shows short clips from programmes and they they get around.
41:31
You got programmes on TV like like Gogglebox, which isn't something I watch where they get away with showing short clips because of a certain
41:38
amount of things you can do with either no royalties or very minimal royalties for that.
41:45
So there are there are things shouldn't be a major problem,
41:51
but I would tread a bit with care if you're going to use the clips as is without any modification.
41:54
Another thing people might do is put the clip up in a TV screen in the corner of the screen and have something else in the foreground.
42:01
It possibly disguises. It's a bit or looks like modification. You can't.
42:08
You can't claim academic fair use.
42:13
Let's say you're doing these videos on YouTube there, then YouTube will not give you time to claim that they will just pull the video first.
42:15
No caps. So all these things are quite, yeah, quite tricky type questions.
42:26
And there are things a few people want to do short videos that they can do.
42:37
We talked a bit about these before just simple things like somebody's typing on a screen or showing
42:41
scrolling through some websites can be very quick video clip or some of these services online.
42:47
And there are three versions where you can generate a short animated video for for 20 seconds to play, showing something.
42:55
There are lots of ways to produce essentially your own video without needing to know a lot about video production,
43:04
which can go in and illustrate things as well,
43:09
which can be quite nice just to break up your presentation so long as are relevant to what you're doing there.
43:12
And there are also free video clips around which are royalty free and intended for reuse.
43:20
And there are things that are so old that a copyright not that you got possibly
43:25
going to want to put a short clip of 1920s Frankenstein or whatever it might be.
43:28
But in theory, these things do exist out there.
43:34
And then there are things like the U.S. government that make a lot of public domain materials available, including video clips.
43:38
So there are there are things a lot of people just go away and use video clips and don't worry about it, but you should be a bit more cautious.
43:45
Do you have to physically show yourselves the presentation or can voice over recorded screen?
43:56
Well, the assignment brief us can show yourself at least 30 seconds each from my memory there and really,
44:01
we want to see you because otherwise we do not know who has done this video and you could have just got your friends to
44:07
do it or someone else to do it as we want at least some level of assurance that the right people are handling this in.
44:13
And we just think if you were doing this in a live presentation setting, people would see you.
44:23
So let's not only say to be particularly scared about.
44:30
Play made a bit of a comment earlier about how smart should you be dressed for these presentations?
44:34
It's a, you know, I wouldn't go out there and give a presentation in and who do you the T-shirt?
44:40
That's the level of how much I dress up will vary depending on the circumstance,
44:47
but you'll find plenty of lecturers who would quite happily go out there and present in a hoodie and teach.
44:54
Even the ones who probably should have stopped wearing hoodies 20 years ago. So it's the end.
44:59
If I say this in front of such members of staff and say that we'd like students make at least a little bit of an effort for presentation,
45:05
there are people in the parliament who will shoot me down to say that because they believe very differently.
45:12
But my view is for presentation.
45:16
The presenters should try and make an effort to look slightly more presentable than the audience that's in most walks of life.
45:19
Yeah, I'll say quite a lot to this.
45:27
If you if you've done Skomal or you've been in some I'd companies around London, you'll find that most techie people don't wear suits.
45:31
In fact, you know, jeans and t shirts is probably the norm in a lot of I.T. companies in this country now.
45:41
So that's fine. But another way of putting it, you know, you can wear what you like, but you may be making the video in your bedroom.
45:52
If you do it in your night clothes, you are making a statement, right?
45:59
I'm not really sure what exactly you're saying, but you are making a statement.
46:03
Do you want to make that statement? Question mark? That's the way I would put it if you record your video in your pyjamas or your underwear.
46:08
Do you want to make that statement? That's all I'll say. Because it is a statement.
46:20
Yeah. I mean, we won't say there are no circumstances where.
46:27
You know, I mean, there may be some times when that statement is appropriate for that.
46:33
Probably not in the type of presentations you're doing here.
46:41
We'd be quite surprised if we if we see that happen there,
46:45
but sometimes people do do a little of acting or they do a little bit of a, dare I say, a skit or something.
46:51
So just to make their video memorable. And I'm certainly not saying present in your underwear,
46:56
but let me give let me give an example that I have a group project a couple of years ago
47:03
where the students were doing a system to to manage bike hire anticompetitive bike companies.
47:09
And so somebody came into the presentation with that bike and dressed in bike gear.
47:15
And then I then I think then they they changed. So sometimes these things can work, but they have to be relevant for that.
47:24
And there's a question about and see the person's name can't log into the peer review system.
47:35
I will I will investigate that one separately and get back to you.
47:40
This is one of many systems developed in house if this was developed by by some students over the last summer and a year.
47:45
Little quirks with it there that we've been we've been looking for.
47:54
But if things aren't correctly linked up, then occasionally, yeah, occasionally their issues are a bit surprised.
47:59
But I will go away and try and track down what's happened there.
48:06
So don't worry about that one. Got your name?
48:09
And how should the members of the group introduce themselves all at once at the beginning or when they start presenting during the presentation?
48:14
I would personally, I would keep present.
48:20
I would keep introductions short because they eat into your time to present the the meat of your presentation.
48:23
So I would have a very strong title slide. I would have the the topic as a good title.
48:33
Not necessarily the exact words that we gave you to start off something that's catchy.
48:42
I would put the names of the people on that slide as well. I wouldn't necessarily put your group.
48:48
No. You can do if you want grabbing your group number is the group number for this assignment is not the same as your pity party group.
48:55
No. You just put that in small if you want to include it.
49:03
But Will will know who is attached to that one.
49:07
And I prefer you to to get straight into the content myself rather than wasting time on long introductions unless it's really relevant.
49:12
Yeah, stretch into the content. I mean, some some people might do things like, for instance, shows just for people in a group.
49:25
You could easily show yourselves just in info boxes on the screen,
49:34
which essentially is just a Zoom view or teams view that if recorded from there, just to just to start things off, that is possible.
49:37
It might be overcomplicated, but otherwise I would say get straight into the presentation.
49:47
The peer assessment, just clicking on the link in the chat worked fine for me.
49:54
And things often done. So I think it is working. Yeah, I don't think maybe just a group.
49:59
Yeah, just groups that are not for some reason linked up properly.
50:05
But I will. Yeah, well, what? I want out as easy to solve.
50:10
We've got more than 24 hours. If it still doesn't solve this time tomorrow and we have just a quick catch up, then.
50:14
But let me know. And if you say something in the script, but it's not being shown on the PowerPoint,
50:21
like explaining a graph of visualisation, then do you need to reference something factual, you say?
50:29
Well, I mean, if it's a graph of visualisation and presumably that is going to be on the slide, otherwise it wouldn't be much use to talk about it.
50:39
So I'm not sure I completely fell on the question or I understand this question.
50:46
But if it's an explanation of a graph or visualisation, then I don't think you need to reference because it's an explanation.
50:51
Yeah, I mean, the reference might be there might be a reference to the graph on this on the on the slide.
51:00
I mean,
51:07
let's say you have a graph from source one and then you've got a criticism of the graph from Source two and you want to talk about the criticism.
51:08
Then maybe my recommendation would be just to put a few words about the criticism on that slide with the citation.
51:17
I then then go into more detail in the presentation or in the script if we call it the script.
51:24
Another possible approach might be to still put the citation on the slide there for the criticism and then to
51:32
verbally mention that these authors had this criticism and the full references on the slide or something like that,
51:42
but that's slightly. Slightly ugly or slightly awkward to do it that way.
51:50
But there isn't this isn't always a perfect way to do these things.
52:00
And just and if you're worried about space to do all these things and to fit both on the slide,
52:08
then what you could do is have slide one, which has the grass taking up the full slide, then slide to where you see the graph.
52:14
You move to only take up part of the screen and then you have the room for a bit more text underneath so you can get away with things like that.
52:22
And also, that means you keep your presentation, your video moving faster, which keeps the audience interested.
52:30
So they're not doing anything very interactive with you today, it's just being us talking and answering questions, I'm really showing you anything.
52:38
And we've been selling a few copies of Blair's books. No, I doubt it.
52:49
It's not like the old days where they would bring copies of your books for you to sign.
53:00
Many we're about at the end of our time, so anyone, any final questions,
53:08
I think you will have everything you need to go and get on the happiest great questions today.
53:13
So thank you. For the years, I was worried you wouldn't have enough to fill it out or at this point, but we're still there.
53:17
It's like the deadlines focus everyone's minds, hours as well.
53:23
So it's. That's true. Yeah.
53:27
Great. Well, did try and get everything finished in in good time, I know you will just so you can go, screw and check the video edited if needed.
53:34
Make sure the sound is balanced. Make sure everybody is audible there.
53:45
We don't want what happened last year, where one group had less time to edit the video.
53:51
They just uploaded lots of short video clips because we're not going to do very much
53:56
with those with the best will in the world and try and piece it together ourselves.
54:00
So make it easier for everyone.
54:04
But I know this will be great, and so we will catch up tomorrow just for anyone who wants to ask any questions or check anything.
54:07
But otherwise, yeah. Thanks as always for joining us and asking Ted if we could help.
54:17
Just otherwise. Just just keep going.
54:24
