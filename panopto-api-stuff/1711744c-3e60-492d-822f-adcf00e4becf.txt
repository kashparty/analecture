Title: Ocado Technology ACI Talk Oct 2021
Category: Applications of Computing in Industry (ACI) Talks
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 28/10/2021
Thanks, Tom. So welcome, everybody, to today's Applications of Computing Industry Seminar.
0:03
We've got one of our great today, Dr. David Sharp, a former Defence Department,
0:10
former lecturer member of our industrial advisory board and someone who's done magnificent
0:17
things as a Secada in terms of leading the charge into all sorts of advanced technologies,
0:24
which is exactly what David's going to tell us about today. So, David.
0:33
Yes, please take it away. Right. Thank you very much. Well, it's a pleasure to be back.
0:37
So I'm in the Advanced Technology Department at Al-Qadi, led by Dr Alex Harvey.
0:42
And I am David Sharpe. I'm head of Autonomous Mobility, which is all about delivering things,
0:49
using autonomous systems on roads and pavements, in warehouses, outside warehouses.
0:54
And so I'll give you a little tour of what we're up to.
1:00
And this particular area of interest for you might be to have an internship, but let's say there's internships, okay, internship.
1:04
And if you're at the point where you'd like to have a contract job or another job, then it's jobs, dot.
1:13
Okay, don't do the places to go and apply.
1:19
And so we're looking for those people, particularly ones like this, to help restore the balance of the profession.
1:23
OK, so what we can do today, we'll have a look at Acardo technology.
1:30
So this is the company that I work for and that creates of the robotic warehouses that are being rolled out around the world will go and
1:33
zoom into robotic space to moving things around and also for picking when you want to transfer stuff from one place to another place.
1:40
We'll have a look at their card. Smart platform, which is the combination of e-commerce and robotics that's being sold around the world by Acardo.
1:47
And finally, we'll have a look at what we're up to.
1:55
My team in Autonomous Mobility, where we're looking at self-driving systems that can deliver your groceries to.
1:57
OK, so a kind of technology, so we're technology pioneers, we're an innovator in e-commerce, robotic warehousing and smart logistics.
2:05
There's almost two thousand five hundred engineers, software, electronics, mechanics,
2:14
robotics and data science people based in 11 to set development centres around the world now.
2:18
So we're based in the UK and places in Europe, and we've also got offices now in America and Canada.
2:25
We have a whole bunch of cutting edge technologies so we can buy an artificial intelligence machine, learning,
2:34
swarming robots, simulation and digital twins, Internet of things and clouds all together to create amazing systems.
2:39
And we're offering over 20 internship's each year now. And these can be for undergraduate or PhD students.
2:46
You're welcome to apply.
2:52
You can do something of the summer for three months as the summer internship or if you need to have industrial placement for six months,
2:53
that's fine too. Just let us know and we can do kind of April till September.
2:59
And the internships are category characterised, I think, in to this year, the software ones and those robotics ones.
3:03
So if you are interested in autonomous mobility, say, self-driving vehicles, that comes under the robotics ones.
3:09
If you're interested in e commerce, it comes up with software once. OK.
3:16
So the technology that we make at the technology is used in the UK by Accardo.
3:23
So you probably see the vans driving around outside Imperial and Acardo.
3:29
Dotcom is now just one of many retailers using this platform. So the other one in the UK is Morison's.
3:34
They also use our platform. So Acardo, that's the one that's now a joint venture with Marks and Spencer has over two
3:39
billion pounds of retail sales and three hundred thirty thousand orders per week,
3:46
six hundred eighty thousand customers. And the orders are typically what you feed a family for, for a week or so.
3:52
So there's about 50 items in the order and they cost about 100.
3:58
And if you've got some 300000 orders and 50 items in each, you've got to pick about 50 million grocery items every week.
4:03
And so it's the way you do that picking that is very important because otherwise it's very expensive.
4:09
And that's what the card is very good at.
4:14
We've also got a very wide catalogue of fifty thousand items, so that's probably twice as much as you could buy in Tesco biggest stores.
4:17
And yet we managed to deliver this incredibly accurately. So it's 99 percent order level accuracy.
4:25
A lot of the time you get exactly what you ordered.
4:30
And that's actually quite unusual for companies to pick from a store where they don't really know what's in the store at the time you want things.
4:32
We also have the industry leading waste really have nought point four percent waste, whereas the industry is around two to three percent.
4:39
And that's a combination of knowing what's in the warehouse. Very well and also very clever forecasting algorithms.
4:45
So my team was involved in improving the way we use neural networks, forecasting,
4:51
making massive improvements to the wastage and the warehouses looked like great big, enormous buildings with lorries parked outside.
4:56
So the one on the left here is our one in Dordogne, in Birmingham, that's five football pitches in size.
5:03
And we've got another one in areas in East London now, which is seven a half of football pitches in size.
5:09
And we're building new warehouses in the UK now in Bristol, Purfleet, and we're rebuilding one in and over the burnt down.
5:15
And so Acardo will be able to sell roughly 40 percent more stuff next year than it can this year as a result, these new warehouses.
5:21
So a lot of the skill in the Carlotto is to do with optimisation algorithms, so in reaching, we have a whole lot of things that have to happen.
5:30
So you have forty thousand orders per day. Each van can do 20 drops,
5:38
so customer deliveries per day and there's about two thousand vans and we're delivering in
5:43
one hour slots and there's a weight limit on the van which constrains how much you can carry.
5:48
And there's also a volume limit on demand which constrains how many packets you can carry.
5:52
And so we have to optimise whose orders go on, which vans and which vans drive from which places,
5:58
which are the places in order to make an optimal delivery schedule.
6:04
And that requires about 600 thousand reaching lessons per second.
6:08
And it also requires very accurate forecasting so that we're buying the right things for people next week.
6:11
And so one of the key questions we have to keep asking is how many strawberries do you need next Thursday in all the different geographies?
6:17
And we use a variety of hands. We've got the little ones that we recognise on the streets.
6:24
These blueberry middle ones are electric vans and the ones on the right here run on gas.
6:27
And they used to take groceries, picked one of the warehouses off to a redistribution site,
6:33
which is where we unload these big lorries and put them on a little fence to do the deliveries.
6:39
And so if we have a look at a video of a typical day from our Hatfield and warehouses.
6:46
You can see that. We sent big lorries out to these sites like Indult, for example,
6:53
and then each of these little drops is a little van that's dropping its shopping at somebody's house.
7:01
And to get to Leeds will have sent those big lorries up, unloaded from the vans and then redistributed it.
7:06
Bristo We've now got a warehouse and then the Southampton area will get served by the end of the warehouse as it ramps up.
7:12
So you can see in London is a major area of activities and lots of deliveries in London.
7:20
And then in the course of the day we've covered basically the middle of the country and
7:25
then we're hoping over time to expand outwards so we can cover more and more people,
7:29
particularly now that we are in partnership with Marks and Spencers.
7:35
We've got more sites around the country. OK, so that's the kind of technology and called it retail.
7:38
Now let's zoom into some of the robotics to get a feel for what's going on there.
7:46
OK, so the groceries now picked using these kinds of grocery boxes are stacked one on top of the other.
7:50
Up to about twenty one boxes high. And then we've got a frame structure which call the grid that keeps everything in position.
7:58
And on top of it, we have robots that move around that about the size of a washing machine and actually heavier than a washing machine as well.
8:06
So these robots travel at about nine miles an hour. They pass just five millimetres apart, which in hindsight probably was a little bit too close.
8:15
That's what they do most of the time, listening to each other. And the boss can pick a 50 item order in five minutes.
8:24
And so that's what's amazing about them.
8:30
If your shopping orders got 50 items in it, we can send tens of bots to pick it up to fetch the items for you.
8:32
And so we can get those items together way quicker than you could get in our shop.
8:38
And then we monitor the performance of everything and feed about four terabytes a day into into
8:44
machine learning how to do diagnosis on health and operate the system because it's so dense,
8:49
thousands of robots on these grids and we have to create new radio communication system.
8:57
And so this enables a thousand robots to be controlled by each space station.
9:03
So that's more dense than a mobile phone network, for example. And it gives us a few kilobits the second each robot.
9:07
So we can talk to them ten times a second, keep them on course.
9:12
And this all fits into half a Wi-Fi channel. So it's very, very efficient use of spectrum.
9:17
So here's is a simulation of the hive and using a simulation before you build a warehouse
9:23
to try and estimate how many orders per week you're going to get and say here,
9:27
each of those green and purple and dark green boxes is a robot.
9:33
And it's not a simulated grid creating a kind of computer game software.
9:39
And then around the various stations where we can take things out in and out of the robots and then through the middle of it,
9:44
as you drop down, this is where we do the picking.
9:53
So boxes drop through the ceiling with the groceries. And then human pickers or robot pickers work in this tunnel here in order to transfer cucumbers
9:57
and bananas from one box of cucumbers to the box that's going to go to somebody's house.
10:06
And so that's how we develop the software.
10:12
The software was tested in simulation before we then used it to control the real warehouse as a result of which we, I think,
10:14
had virtually no problems in the real warehouse due to bugs in this roofing software because they were all on the outside while we did the simulation.
10:23
OK, and here's some some drone footage of some of the actual warehouse in Earth,
10:32
and you can see the robots zooming past each other with their little green lights to say that they they're connected to the main system.
10:38
You can see that each robot has got three aerials. So it has two areas for its communications and then it has an extra area, which is a safety area.
10:45
So these robots only work if they can hear the safety signal. So in the event that we have to rescue robot by sending somebody onto this bridge
10:53
of robots like that yellow flashing back that we talked about in the press,
11:00
and then all the robots will go to sleep, well, we will come to rescue the one that's stranded and that's got the same safety integrity
11:05
level as kind of a train signalling system or a plane to make sure nobody gets hurt.
11:13
So it's called syllabary safety, integrity, defenestrate. And so that's the great.
11:18
Very inspiring sights when you sit then in the middle of the grid.
11:25
We have the people who are doing the picking so you can just about see boxes dropping down from the ceiling on the left of this picture.
11:28
And then the human picture is taking stuff out of the white boxes on the left hand side
11:36
and putting it into the red boxes that go to people's houses on the right hand side.
11:41
And this is the size of one of the robots that you can see roughly. Smaller than a person, but heavier person.
11:48
OK, so that's one type of the robot, the washing machine,
11:58
robots of the warehouse robots that move boxes around and then the other type of robots that we got for picking things.
12:00
So here's a computer vision algorithm that's having a look at some yoghurt cartons.
12:07
And the red areas are there are areas that it feels it can pick up a yoghurt cotton using a second device.
12:11
And we've now got this stuff through the research stage into development and into production.
12:18
And so here at Erith, we've actually got live robotic thinking happening now.
12:23
So this is used as a suction cup to hold can.
12:27
And then you release the suction and it drops the kind of packet of something into it, into the right box.
12:30
And these are also shown on video control so that we can have one person supervising several robots.
12:36
And that way it's a much more commercially efficient way of operating warehouse than having
12:41
to have a person on each of these sections as a whole lot of research going on now,
12:45
which is to develop the technology to the point that we can pick a bigger variety of the range.
12:50
And this leads for Horizon 2020 projects that we did. So here's one called Samus of Manipulation in which she would shoot some blow up hands in
12:57
association with some university collaborators for picking some fruit without damaging it.
13:06
And we've gone on beyond this now. And if you look at the right,
13:11
you can see this hand is now able to push a cucumber against the wall of the box and then grab hold of it using the wall as part of the way it works.
13:14
So we're not going to much more sophisticated algorithms for robots.
13:23
We also did a project called Second Hands collaborating with UCLA and some universities in Europe.
13:29
And here we were taking the first steps towards trying to build humanoid robots, which we feel is probably the ultimate destination in robotics.
13:34
And so is our humanoid robot trying to pick up a spray bottle for convenience.
13:46
We didn't give it any legs for this experiment. We just got it on a roller like a doctor dog.
13:52
And this robot is essentially practising working with other humans.
13:58
So passing things from one level to one human flight,
14:02
you have to do a lot of estimation of the human to work out exactly how you're going to get something positive assessment.
14:06
OK, so that's what we've been up to in robots. Now, how are we putting all this together?
14:12
So we put it together and we call it a very smart platform and then we sell it around the world.
14:18
So I've got a small platform is the most advanced e-commerce, logistics and fulfilment platform for groceries that can get in the world.
14:23
It's modular. It's scalable. You've got the make of the web shop and mobile apps ordering automated fulfilment in the robotic warehouses.
14:30
We also offer store picking as a piece of software for our customers abroad because not everybody's got a warehouse yet.
14:38
And of course, all the reaching and deliveries.
14:45
And now we've got several clients around the world in America, in Canada and Europe and Japan and Australia, where we are building robotic warehouses.
14:48
And over the next few years, we think you'll have over 50 robotics warehouses built.
14:57
It's going to be a massive portfolio of robots to manage. And we're also trying to zoom, which is fast food, so grocery in under 60 Minutes,
15:01
this is really useful for parties where you're running short of alcohol.
15:11
You order the alcohol on Zun and then it arrives within an hour and typically 20 to 30 minutes, which is useful.
15:15
So it's been called almost the fourth emergency service, but this has a slightly lower range.
15:21
The ten thousand items.
15:26
Again, 95 percent is on time, very low rates of substitution because we've got superb stock control and most of the baskets here,
15:27
two thirds of all the small shop that people want quickly. Actually, some people just use that as their ordinary Saturday delivery.
15:35
This is only live in Ealing, but we're going to be rolling it out for another 12 sites in the next two years.
15:42
OK, so what about my team, the autonomous mobility team? What are we up to?
15:49
OK, so our aim is to integrate autonomous vehicles into the platform and you can see what we're trying to do here on the bottom left,
15:54
you can see this thing is called a skateboard. So increasingly, some companies like applied the electric vehicles in Melbourne,
16:02
Australia, but also others who are making these kind of four wheel drive road vehicles.
16:10
But they make the bottom of it and they enable it so that it can be driven by a self driving autonomous software.
16:16
And so what you do is you put together one of these skate wheel vehicles with an autonomous software stack.
16:25
And then on the top of it, like on the right here, you build a hutch to retrieve your groceries,
16:30
a bit like a clicking on wheels, and then you have a self driving self delivery system.
16:35
So that's what we're trying to create. So this will be grocery delivery to the kerbside.
16:39
So you won't actually take it to the door at the moment,
16:44
which means you'll have to come out of your house and pick it up from the lock and but maybe there'll be some incentives like other slightly cheaper.
16:46
Maybe you can get more delivery slots or some other incentive. It'll be an autonomous vehicle.
16:54
And the key thing is this needs to be safe with no human inside. So hopefully going to make this slightly smaller than the cars.
17:00
So they're a bit safer at the moment. We're going through the engineering and the regulatory and the legal aspects
17:06
to try and get to the point where we can run these without safety concern. And we're collaborating with two companies to do this.
17:14
One is with Bottega, which is a spin off out of Oxford University.
17:21
And recently we've also started another collaboration with some people, wave based in Kings Cross,
17:24
and they've got another self-driving stack based on end to end neural networks,
17:29
where the experiment is based on a mixture of neural networks and standard software engineering practises.
17:33
OK, and we've just also won some government funding for the project where we're going to try and explore removing safety drivers from cars,
17:40
and this combines with software to transport research laboratory who give guidance on trials and safety cases.
17:49
British Standards Institute are going to generate new software, new standards for self-driving software, including one called eighteen eighty one.
17:57
That was very southerns as well. And the UK alternative energy authorities is providing a road, private area where we can do trials.
18:06
And then Acardo is going to be toward meeting and managing this and particularly trying to sort out
18:16
the safety case to make sure that oil gets produced is safe enough to use it as a safety drive.
18:21
And his McSpadden's we did earlier with occiput a spot here a few years ago, and she was a feel for the sort of vehicle that we might be treating.
18:27
So this one has got H tracery hutches,
18:36
these round sensors on the front of the sides here are light sensors and that's ensures we don't run over like myself,
18:40
which is right in front of the car. And a few years ago, this is self-driving, but got confused quite easily, for example,
18:46
on bin day when the difference because the bins have come out, but recently saw that a lot more machine learning and intelligence into it.
18:53
And so we're hoping to get it to the point where it can self drive successfully sequestrated.
19:01
And one of the ways one of the arguments used inside these sorts of vehicles is you build up a map of the area,
19:07
so you go out, go out mapping it with your cameras,
19:15
and then when the vehicle is live in the area, it can use correlation algorithms to spot which images in the library,
19:18
in the mapping image correspond with it can see life. And that way you can find out where it is visually rather than having to rely on GPS.
19:27
And eventually, we want to go beyond you having to pick up the groceries,
19:37
maybe the groceries should still come to your door, but maybe they should be delivered by robots.
19:41
And so a couple days ago at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, I was delighted to see all these different sorts of robots,
19:46
basically that little silver mini cheetah,
19:54
which is running around saying you have to see about the possibility of actually putting grocery boxes on these sorts of robots in Germany.
19:57
And in fact, I thought it was kind enough to buy a Boston Dynamics spot for us so that we could do a few experiments in our lab.
20:05
So that's the that's the long term vision for this. OK, so that was the talk of college technology, robotics,
20:12
both of moving things around and also for picking the horizontal not platform being rolled out around the world and autonomous mobility,
20:20
the ability to deliver things using driver's licence, lots of acknowledgements of trademarks and slides.
20:27
And so they are ready for questions. And so you've already got your typing ready to go to internships or jobs to operate it.
20:35
But in the meantime, please do ask some questions, don't you?
20:44
Yes. So we have some questions in the chats or already somebody wants to hire first year.
20:48
Yeah. So we have had fun doing internships. Yes.
20:58
So if you're a good first year and are brilliant at your discipline or perhaps you've got a hobby,
21:02
what you've been doing some of the stuff we've been doing already. Yes.
21:07
Yes. Please do apply for an internship. Are the internships at the moment, they're happening remotely, are they going to be back on site again?
21:11
Oh, OK, so that's an interesting question. So over the summer, we did internships where they were if they were suffering internships,
21:19
they were remote and if they were mechanics, electronics, robotics, internships, they were pretty remote and partly in our workshop.
21:29
So at that time, we had a limit on numbers in our workshop. But it's all changing now.
21:38
So at the moment, we're back at work two days a week. So two days a week is in Hatfield or Welwyn Garden City and then three days a week is at home.
21:42
Or if you want to come in for the other three days a week, you're welcome to do so.
21:51
And if you work in the workshop, then you coordinate with workshop to ensure that we don't flood it with too many people.
21:55
But it should be possible this year and nothing changes to do an internship that is partly onsite and partly OK.
22:00
Great as it seems keen to know, how does what's the typical programme for an internship?
22:09
But what does the process look like from I mean, is there an interview and then kind of what happens?
22:16
Yeah. So there's so you apply and you'll get into Parliament and CDs.
22:23
So then people review it to see how wonderful you look. And so we're particularly looking out for hobbies that you've done or stuff where you've had
22:29
a personal interest in robots or I or software development or data science or something.
22:38
So we can kind of get people with the high level of enthusiasm and competence and experience.
22:45
And then there's an interview process where basically we'll check your kind of technical skills in the area that you possess to be brilliant.
22:51
So either software or electronics and mechanics to interview and exercises. And then typically we also have a kind of a values assessment,
22:58
which is where we're trying to see if you're the sort of person who would communicate effectively in one of the Accardo teams.
23:06
And if you survive both of those interviews, then you get to. And then I think the allocation to teams happens later.
23:12
So basically on applying, you decide if you want to buy one or you want to kind of robotics one.
23:19
And then later on, people get allocated to the various teams in economy, which are super keen on autonomous vehicles, you should say, on average.
23:23
Fantastic questions like tonight, is there any particular tech stock you work with or what kind of skills are you looking for particular?
23:32
Yeah, OK, so this is going to test me, right? So most of the e-commerce development of backend systems is done in Java and then Acardo
23:41
has got a whole load of cloud software based libraries and security constraints and so on,
23:51
that you'll see you'll learn how to use. And a lot of the latest software is running on Amazon Web Services and on Google Cloud as well.
23:58
And so you'll get some experience with using those.
24:07
For data science and machine learning, we obviously use Python and Flow and some of the latest kind of Google related techniques.
24:13
And then for the embedded systems, we're largely using C++. So if you've got experience of playing with Arduino or Raspberry Pi,
24:23
making bits of electronics or robotics type kit, then that's particularly of interest.
24:32
And then for front ends, we're largely using typescript and JavaScript based sort of software and we're also using.
24:38
And why use an Android as well in the in the mobile apps?
24:48
Great, somebody else is curious, are your robot arm, computer vision algorithms, classical, deep learning based may come with the expertise, right?
24:53
Yes. OK, so the answer is we do everything. So some of our computer vision is just classical stuff.
25:04
So this is basically taking what you'd find an open CD, for example, and then we then use proprietary techniques to extend it.
25:12
We have quite a few people, PhDs in robotics,
25:20
so they will then take their classical algorithms and extend it even further if you want to pick up cucumbers.
25:23
The last cucumber in the box, that's got some incredibly clever electromechanical analysis and maths that went behind it and was working out there.
25:29
And so that's kind of one aspect. And then the other aspect is we are also doing some end to end learning for the robot picking.
25:36
And this is pretty phenomenal what you can achieve.
25:45
So you're basically getting a vision system to look at a person using VR controllers to move the robot to pick stuff up.
25:49
And then the the the deep learning system can enter and learn the association between what it can see and what you then do.
26:03
And it can then copy that and generalise.
26:11
And so you're using that we are able to train robots to pick things up simply by learning, by even demonstrating.
26:14
So hopefully of technologies being used and interestingly, we have more or less doing the same for autonomous mobility for vehicles.
26:22
So our collaboration with the to break things down into components, so we separate the machine, learning the recognition,
26:33
the recognition of objects moving in the scene and then the path planning and then the
26:41
decision about where the car goes into components that are then engineered and put together.
26:46
And Wave is taking the different approach, which is to enter and learn how to drive.
26:50
So the theme recurs across multiple areas. Vernon,
26:56
things I've been curious in your own view of how al-Qaida has changed over the years because it used to be a
27:02
relatively small and unknown company and then suddenly it burst onto the scene and became a huge tech kind of star.
27:11
Has how has that affected the company and other external pressures now on on the company from,
27:22
for example, shareholders and so on, that you didn't just have to deal with before?
27:32
So I always been quite lucky in terms of shareholders. So it's got 10 or 11 very large shareholders plus the rest of it's just on the stock exchange.
27:37
And so the influence of the 10 or 11 big shareholders is still there.
27:46
And so the ability to have bold visions and invest in technology to achieve amazing things is still there in much the major shareholders,
27:51
which is which is great to it, keeps going and ambitious. And then he says the company itself, it's it's grown considerably.
27:59
So it's had to put in place big systems that handle expenses, for example.
28:07
So this is a bit more bureaucracy than there was. But there's also now much more development power than there was.
28:12
Say, for example, we've got to develop offices in Poland, one in Barcelona, one in Sofia.
28:17
We've got a robotics office in Las Vegas.
28:23
We've got offices in Canada on the West Coast.
28:27
So it's become much more geographically intense in terms of the possibility of
28:32
travelling to places and working in different places and learning different things. It's also got a much bigger cheque book now for buying companies.
28:37
So in the last couple of years, it's bought a few robotics companies and a vertical farming food company.
28:44
And so that adds to the kind of engineering capability and the diversity of things that the country is able to do.
28:53
Great Victor has a question about if you aspire to graduate job in autonomous mode,
29:02
ability or robotics, is it the best option to apply for an engineering or a software graduate?
29:09
Placement. So if you spy for which job, a job in a graduate job in autonomous mobility or robotics research.
29:18
I see. Yeah, so so you need to go for the robotics placements. So so the robotics ones, robots and also autonomous mobility.
29:29
And getting an internship, if you're able to get one, is a great, great thing to have if you really bring an experience.
29:36
And in fact, we also make job offers to our successful interns as well.
29:43
So it also gives you an excuse to focus on your academic studies in your final year is something to try to find a job.
29:47
So it's a great group. It's quite competitive to get them right.
29:53
And in terms of the students you would take from those which you look more for electrical engineering or software engineering students,
29:56
do you think so? We will take them all.
30:02
So software engineering, electrical engineering, design, engineering, mechanical engineering, all the diversity of engineering is needed.
30:04
Great, fantastic. Bittar says he's a bit disappointed because he can't find a robotics placement,
30:12
but he's he's in his final year and on the hunt for something like that.
30:19
So he should probably just contact you right now.
30:25
You can just drop an email if you so David shop at Picardo dot com and I can point you in the right direction.
30:27
Right. Another good question here about the safety of all the systems that you developed
30:33
and you mentioned some of them around the ones in the the robots in the warehouse.
30:41
I mean, I presume the safety concerns around other things like autonomous driving are a lot more more severe.
30:49
And it is the does the style of system that you using make it more difficult to certify.
30:56
Right. So I presume if you have an autonomous driving system,
31:06
which is just like end to end neural neural networks that have not necessarily been exposed to every possible circumstance,
31:10
it might be harder to get safety certification for that. Yes, exactly.
31:19
Spot on. So that's why we've got a portfolio of approaches. So the bottega approach is more traditional in getting safety certification because
31:23
you've basically got to certify each component and then certify the whole thing works.
31:33
And obviously you need a lot of testing, both in simulation and also in real to get enough experience that the thing will
31:39
operate safely and the wave approach where you've basically got end to end learning.
31:47
You're correct, getting that sort of thing, safety credits is just going to be more challenging.
31:52
And there's some areas, I think, which we don't know fully the answers to yet. So, for example, if an optical vehicle is involved in an accident,
31:57
then that's what will have a complete traceable stack of what happened and what decisions were made and why.
32:06
And what we've seen in Wave, we'll have whatever the neural network can tell us about what they actually didn't.
32:10
And so the challenge of getting neural networks to articulate what it is they
32:18
did and why they did it is still essentially open and open research challenge,
32:23
which obviously we're going to need to make progress with in order to get to the
32:27
point where we can reassure ourselves that these internal systems are safe.
32:31
And there's also a big question to do with simulation. To what extent do you need to simulate?
32:35
Do you have to simulate essentially a computer game which looks identical to real life?
32:40
Do you have to simulate all the lie down and radar readings that you would you would get what?
32:45
You just have to simulate the situation and let the car tell you what decisions it would make in that situation.
32:49
So these are kind of all open questions. And at the moment,
32:57
the UK government has got a legislative consultation going on where it's trying to work out
33:00
what the self driving car laws should be and what sort of driving test they should go through.
33:06
So it's all cutting edge stuff. Yeah, very exciting. I must say.
33:11
I've seen some terrifying videos where self-driving cars made by others have kind of half veered off the motorway and sort of
33:15
half decided that it would go down the exit ramp and half stay on the motorway and end up heading towards the concrete barrier.
33:24
That separates the two of the very worrying kind of amendment, right? Yes.
33:31
And not a great moment for indecision, was it not? No.
33:35
Obviously, taking the average of the two, but not not not not the right not the right thing to be doing good.
33:40
Another student asks, do you have some kind of mailing list where you keep in touch with people who might be interested in opportunities?
33:49
Or should students simply keep their eyes on the internships and jobs websites?
33:57
So maybe we don't have a mailing list.
34:02
So I think keep your eye on the internships and jobs and if you can't find what you want, then drop me an email to David Bookshop.
34:05
That's great. Yes, taking the average of the two parts,
34:15
how a statistical statistician would drive absolutely good quantum mechanical engineer would, of course choose one or the other.
34:18
But the certain elements of fantastic. Yeah, ICARDA is not quite far flung around the globe, right?
34:28
Are there opportunities for students to do their placements and stuff in other countries?
34:36
So that's an interesting question. I think at the moment we're mainly doing them in Hatfield and Wellin.
34:42
But I think in principle, I'm not aware of a reason why we wouldn't be able to do one in, for example, Poland or Barcelona or Saffir.
34:50
I think you're super interested in that. Then you should probably say so on your application.
35:00
If you happens to be a world leading roboticist in your spare time and you needed to go to Las
35:06
Vegas to do some sort of robot research or to learn how to print robots out of 3D printers,
35:12
you should put that in your application. And if you don't offer it, yes, at least at least it would give us the idea of having it in the future.
35:19
Great, maybe you can practise some laser roulette wheel scanning while you're there.
35:28
Did anybody else have have questions? No, I think you have slain everybody with your tour de force, the David, thank you very much, as usual.
35:36
An amazing sweeping overview of so much exciting developments.
35:53
So I'm sure you're going to get a good response from the students.
36:01
Just one more thing. Students very keen to know what are their interviews and what is the process like?
36:06
OK, so, yes, there are interviews,
36:14
so there's technical interviews and then there's kind of interpersonal skills interviews and I think if you want to know more,
36:16
you probably need to apply and then they'll tell you what the process will be for this year.
36:24
OK, brilliant. All right, well, I think then we can draw that closer to no further questions from anyone.
36:28
Thank you very much, David. That was that was great. I hope to be able to see you in person soon for an event maybe.
36:37
And thanks very much. Great. Thank you for listening.
36:46
OK, bye bye.
