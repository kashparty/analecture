Title: Induction over Numbers - 1
Category: 1 - Induction over Numbers
Lecturer: Sophia Drossopoulou
Date: 23/01/2021
Induction can be used to prove properties, statements of the form for all X out of a set s the property holds for that X and we need to have the we
0:02
need to be so that the S is an innumerable set and the B is a property over that set because a subset of S.
0:16
And we can then look at couple of such examples of properties of innumerable assets.
0:26
One needs that for all number seven to the part of that number plus five is exactly divisible by three or four.
0:33
We can express our example with the princess and the frogs.
0:42
If we'll have a plank of length and in the end frogs are needed, then eventually all the frogs will be returned to the princes or last.
0:47
We can even expressed properties of lists. So if we have to list X's and Y's if cognata to list,
0:57
then we have the same length as if we added the length of the first part to the length of the second part.
1:05
And would you have seen inductive prints to be ready?
1:15
What it says is that if the property holds for zero and for all numbers, K, if it holds for K, it also holds four, K plus one.
1:23
Then we know that it calls for natural numbers. And you might have already seen this principally in the first term when you saw it,
1:34
discrete structures that are beyond all description of the natural numbers, but for our purposes.
1:47
So all we need to do is remember that this is the principle of mathematical induction.
1:56
So now we want to apply this principle to the properties that you have already seen at school, namely that the sum of the numbers from zero until an.
2:04
Is the same as the product of an we then plus one divided by two.
2:18
And you probably have seen this proof your school already. But what we want to do is go.
2:27
As I said earlier, go from the induction principle for this particular property to the proof schema to the complete proof.
2:32
So here is your turn.
2:43
Please try to apply the induction principally that we just saw for all properties to piece to the particular properties that we have here.
2:47
So we wanted to apply the induction principles that is here.
3:01
To the particular property that is described here.
3:05
So all we need to do is replace B of zero by the instance of this property where we replace all appearances of N Black by zero.
3:10
So P of zero will now be replaced by the sum of the numbers from zero.
3:21
I'm taking zero. Is equal with zero times zero plus one divided by two.
3:30
So you see that they have replaced all occurrences of N.
3:45
Line zero. And I have indicated it through red.
3:50
And now we have to look at the second part. Now we need to require that for all K out of the natural numbers.
3:55
If the sum of the numbers from zero to K.
4:06
Is the product that we expected it to be.
4:11
Then some of the numbers from 03 K plus one.
4:17
He's going to be the product of K plus one times. Kate plus one plus one divided by two.
4:24
So this bit here is the property for Kay.
4:36
And this is the property for Kay plus one. And you'll see that in there.
4:40
I have replaced or Currentzis of N by Kay. And in here I have replaced that.
4:46
I can say that we replaced all occurrences of over and by K plus one.
4:54
And if these two conditions hold, then we know that the appropriate home torok.
5:01
Not sure. No. So for lot of natural numbers, the sum from zero, the end is the product of and times.
5:08
And plus one divided by two. And then this slide, we can see it again, beautifully written out.
5:19
You'll see that in here. I have got the property of zero in here.
5:31
I have got the property K. in here. I have got the property for K plus one.
5:37
We will be practising this in a couple more times.
5:45
But if there are questions when you watch the videos, please put your questions up on Piazza or ask the questions when we have the meeting on Tuesday.
5:51
So once we have the inductive principally for the property we're interested in.
6:02
We want to right the proof schema. And the proof schema will consist of a base case and an inductive step.
6:06
Remember, the inductive principle for what we want to prove is here with the right of the slide near,
6:26
what you want to do is fill in this bit here to say how what should be proven in the base case?
6:35
What should be proven in inductive step? And now, again, it's your turn.
6:43
Please try to Felitti. Take as long as you need.
6:49
Pause the video and come back when we have finished so we will not be driving.
6:53
The proof schema in the base case we need to prove.
7:00
The first part of the conjunct. So what we have to prove is that the sum of the numbers from zero until zero is what is there on the right hand side.
7:05
The inductive step is a bit more interesting because look at the inductive step.
7:17
It says for. Okay. Something about scale.
7:22
And as you remember from last week, whenever we want to prove some property for wrong ex,
7:28
we often can do it by started by taking the X arbitrary and then proving that.
7:34
So that's exactly what we will do here. We will say we take AK out of that nut shell numbers and this case is arbitrary.
7:42
OK, so now we have to prove this bit. And this part is an implication.
7:52
It has got the form. If A, then B.
8:00
Again, remember what we did last week? We said if we want to prove an implication, then what we do is we assume the left hand side.
8:06
So we will assume that the property calls for the sum up the UK.
8:15
And this assumption we call induction hypothesis. This is a standard term to talk about the left hand side in the second conjunct in the principle.
8:23
So we assume in the impactive hypothesis that the sum of the numbers up K.
8:36
Is what is said there and then what we want to show.
8:46
Is the right side of the implication this big here? So what we want to show is that not some of the numbers from zero up the Kate plus one.
8:52
Is the product on the next slide, we can see the same thing written a bit more nicely.
9:04
So the base case is the proof of those first conjunct and then back in the inductive step where we want to prove this implication.
9:15
What we do is we first take the arbitrary kay.
9:27
And then an inductive hypothesis, we assume the left hand side of the application.
9:34
And what we need to show afterwards is the right hand side of the implication.
9:41
If there are any questions about these police.
9:50
Come back to me on Piazza or on Tuesday when we discuss, we will be seeing this process a couple of more times.
9:55
And I hope that for some of you, there is an element of surprise, at least for me.
10:04
I had seen the proof by deduction, and that's school, but it was something kind of magic and mysterious.
10:10
And when I realised that the birth production is actually nothing else,
10:17
then a systematic derivation from the induction praising Supre using what we already knew in logic.
10:21
It was a surprise and it was a revelation. So I hope you do enjoy that.
10:30
We will not move to proving this property. And I would like to remind you of all the good things that we agreed on last week when we
10:38
tried to prove we wanted to be very clear about what is given and what we want to prove.
10:48
We want to make every proof step explicit. We want to justify each step we want.
10:53
By indicating which properties with assumptions which lemons we used for that particular step.
10:59
So we cannot just right now. I know that. A whole lot, we need to say.
11:06
Why? What gives us the right to assert that a home is a good way of doing that is by giving
11:12
names to the intermediate result so we can refer to these when we use them later,
11:20
when we prove by induction, say, which way to apply the induction principle on.
11:26
And as you go, you will vary the granularity of the proof steps.
11:32
According to the confidence you have and according to the circumstances we have already seen or you already saw, if you look at that.
11:39
The proof of the happy drivers, there is a version that has got three lines, another one that has good 10 lines.
11:49
The steps become bigger. The more confident we are.
11:55
But what we want to have is that every step comes with a justification.
11:59
The reason I want you to write the proof in that stye is because you want to write the proof that you can understand and you avoid making errors,
12:04
but also a proof that you can understand in a month's time.
12:15
And others can understand and others can cheque. So we first.
12:19
Now we would be proving the property about the sons.
12:28
And we will need to prove the inductive step and the I'm sorry.
12:32
We will first need to prove the base case. The base case, it was already given to us.
12:38
We developed it a couple of slides earlier.
12:45
So what we want to show is that the sum of the numbers up three zero zero times zero plus one divided by two.
12:48
And now, again, it's your opportunity to go and read the proofs and come back and cheque.
12:57
So I stuck the roof roof by writing think what I am hoping to show, what I'm hoping to be able to show is that the some of the numbers from zero zero.
13:07
That's the left hand side of this equation is equal with the zero times zero plus one divided by two.
13:18
And I will make the sex explicit. So the sum of the numbers up to zero is zero.
13:30
Why is that so? This is by the definition of what some means.
13:38
And on the other hand, here I am trying to show that this term is equal with that term.
13:45
Why is zero equal with this product?
13:56
Well, this is actually by arithmetic. And I'm done.
14:01
But perhaps it would be even better if I did a couple of steps in between.
14:09
So this is the same as zero time zero divided by two.
14:13
This is by arithmetic. And.
14:18
Then I have reached my goal, but it's important here to be clear that what properties do they use in order to develop the roof?
14:23
I use the definition of some and then you use some properties of.
14:32
Of multiplication, addition and division of fourth, I'm not sure the numbers.
14:39
And here it is, the same proof written a bit nicer for you, and this is in your notes.
14:45
If there are any questions, please let us discuss.
14:55
We will now move to the inductive step. We will now move to the impact step.
15:00
And again, please have the go. Here is how I would be writing the proof for the step.
15:07
Again, I'm starting with what I want to show. And I'm hoping to show that this is the same as the left hand side.
15:22
But actually, I have not shown it yet, so I will put some question marks in there in order to say you need to do some work,
15:38
you kind of take it as given and you hope later on to be able to replace the question marks by some justification.
15:45
So starting now with the left hand side, we can break the sum in two bits, the sum of the numbers up till K plus one.
15:55
Is this some of the numbers up K plus K plus one?
16:07
And again, what I did is I applied the definition of some.
16:11
And now, I mean, the super happy position, I can apply the inductive hypothesis.
16:16
I'm so happy I can imply that inductive hypothesis is that I'm going to write the next step in the right.
16:23
So by inductive hypothesis, which is here, I know that the first sum is K time.
16:29
So K plus one. Divide that by two.
16:41
And then the next that is as was here. And that is by the inductive hypothesis.
16:45
And this is a great point. In every proof and actually when I can apply that in my hypothesis.
16:52
So now I have got two terms, this one and this one, and they look slightly different,
17:05
but I hope that by some arithmetic manipulation, I will be able to turn this time to that.
17:12
And indeed I can. But I'm not going to go through the details here.
17:20
Here it is, inductive step, written out nicely, and it is available in your notes.
17:24
You'll see that I stuck with the left hand side.
17:30
I apply the definition of the sum. Then I apply the inductive hypotheses.
17:35
Then I do some. I just mythic manipulations and I arrive to the right side.
17:41
And now I done. And happy. And here I have finished the complete proof by induction of the property of the sun up the end.
17:46
