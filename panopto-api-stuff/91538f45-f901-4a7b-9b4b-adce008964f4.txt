Title: L07 - Time-Dependent behaviour of digital circuits with feedback (part 1)
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Lluis Vilanova
Date: 27/10/2021
Hello, everyone, and welcome to our seventh lecture. So so far,
0:06
we've become experts in the previous lectures on how to build combinatorial circuits and how to go from boolean equations
0:10
and get these best circuits to things that we can give and some ideas of what our definitions of what best is like,
0:18
for example, having the minimal area for a circuit.
0:25
And but remember here that by coming Turrill circuit or communitarian logic, we mean that when we have an equation,
0:30
one side of the equation, usually the right side of the equation will have all the inputs to that circuit.
0:39
And on the left hand,
0:46
we are going to have the outputs and we will never have directly or indirectly in any of the gates the output of that gate going back as an input.
0:48
That's the definition of combinatorial circuits. And what we are going to see in this lecture is what are the implications when we add some
0:58
kind of loops or what we call feedback by setting the output of gate back into its own input.
1:08
As we will see, this will bring us to looking a bit at a bit lower level at the physics or the electronic design of the
1:15
circuits and what it means in terms of building efficient and more efficient circuit implementations.
1:24
And at the very end of it, we will hint at what comes in the next lecture.
1:32
We're just talking about new circuit designs that we haven't seen so far that
1:36
we can do and are very useful once we break this rule of combinatorial logic.
1:41
So, as I was saying, we are going to be looking at what happens when we build these feedback loops.
1:46
So remember, what we are going to be looking at is getting the output of one gate back into the input of it.
1:55
So here we have one very simple example.
2:01
This is a non gauge, remember, with two inputs.
2:06
One is eight. And the second output of this gate is the sort of the second input of this gate is the same output that we got.
2:11
So let's give it some values and see what happens with the circuit.
2:21
So let's assume that we have a zero on eight and we have some previous value of our which could be one.
2:25
Now, in this case, this one is going to travel over the wire all the way up to the input.
2:33
And we are going to have a one here and then zero now and one is going to be a one.
2:41
So everything is fine because this is going to keep feeding in this loop and the output is going to be one,
2:47
which is exactly what we wanted for this non gate.
2:55
Now, if instead of this, we have one over here as before, but now we have a one on a.
3:00
What happens is that this is going to trouble over here.
3:10
We are going to have. One over here.
3:15
And the result is a zero, which is not what we initially had, so if we look at the equations of what happens with this combination of inputs,
3:19
we have that when A is one with boolean algebra, we will have the R equals, not R, so basically R equals not R.
3:31
So what we can see here is that we just broke the boolean algebra that we knew so far.
3:43
So now the question is, how do we understand what's going on in here?
3:50
And in order to do so, what we are going to be looking at is how these gates are internally implemented using electronics.
3:55
So in this case, when, as I was saying, the model that we knew so far of Boolean equations has broken down,
4:06
once we have feedback loops and with certain inputs and what we are going to do is look at something,
4:15
another model that is closer to the physical realisation of these gates using transistors.
4:25
And that's going to help us explain what exactly is going on and why this is happening inside.
4:32
And in the end, we will see that this is actually beneficial to know because it will allow us to build,
4:39
as I was saying, the very beginning, better and more efficient circuits.
4:44
But also it will allow us to do new types of circuits that we couldn't do until now.
4:47
So for this, we're going to look at two very simple models using electronics or remember.
4:54
In this case, this would be the equivalent of not.
5:02
Mean in logic, which internally is implemented via transistor, that typically we would draw with a symbol like this.
5:08
With your circle over here, but still, this is a very abstract representation of what a transistor is.
5:22
And even though we could look at the very real implementation of it and what would be all the equations involved in it,
5:30
what we are going to do instead is look at two surrogate models that will allow us to understand
5:37
with enough detail what's going on without going into all the innards of what exactly is happening.
5:43
And what these two surrogate models and we will look at is the switch in the model and the resistance and capacitance model.
5:50
So in these two circuits here, we have basically a voltage source, a battery,
5:59
and like any voltage source, it has some intrinsic resistance, which would be our source.
6:08
And then here we have what we are going to use to represent the functionality of our transistor, which is a very special type of switch.
6:17
It's a switch that whenever we have a voltage set on set or voltage of zero, the switch is open.
6:27
So there is no electricity or electrons that can go through it.
6:36
And then we will have a voltage output over here.
6:42
Now, in this model, when we drive in some voltage through this switch over here, after some amount of time,
6:47
some arbitrary amount of time, the switch will close and then we will have some voltage.
6:56
So when the street is open, as you will probably remember from school, when working with electronic circuits,
7:03
with electric circuits excuse me, is that the output voltage will be very similar to the input voltage.
7:14
Over here and accept that there's some resistance at the source,
7:23
and once we close this switch over here, this voltage on the output is going to be much lower.
7:31
So, in fact, we can look at this as implementing the Boolean Northgate that we have over here.
7:39
So when the switch is open, we could say that this is a zero and then voltage and will be very close to the end.
7:49
So we could say that it's a one. And then if we instead set voltage here in the input and close the switch after some time,
7:56
what we are going to see is a much lower voltage, which we can understand as a zero.
8:07
Now, this segador here also has this other resistance here,
8:14
which basically is expressing the resistance of all next gates in the circuit so that they will,
8:21
as we will see later, these resistances keep adding up as we add more gates in the circuit.
8:30
Now, another way to depict or to model this transistor or these not over here is using this resistance and capacitance.
8:37
So basically, instead of having a switch that goes from one to zero by closing one, setting that the input voltage,
8:47
what we have is something that is kind of like a knob that we could turn up and down.
8:57
So the the change in voltage is going to be gradual.
9:04
So at some point when we have the voltage, at minimum, it's going to be equivalent to having the switch open.
9:08
So when V is zero, we are going to have here the equivalent of a Boolean one.
9:15
And then as we turn it up higher and higher, at some point we will have the maximum voltage over here,
9:24
which we're going to represent this one, and then the output is going to be a zero.
9:33
So this one over here is more discrete, more discrete approach to modelling these transistor,
9:38
whereas these other resistance and capacitance model over here is a continuous model of what's going on internally on the transistor.
9:45
So for that, we can now look at what happens on the signals, which is basically a summary of what we just saw here,
9:58
we have for the Swedes and the model, we are on a zero and then at some point we want to close the switch.
10:06
And as we said, after some delay, the voltage in the output is going to go from this one over here all the way down to here.
10:13
That represents a zero. And then once we close or open sorry, the switch again, and by driving the input voltage to zero,
10:21
we are going to switch the output back to one, which is.
10:34
If we understand this zero one zero, as you can see, this is implementing not also it's worth saying if we go back,
10:40
that there's ways to implement other gates by basically playing around with
10:50
additional Switzer's or so with delays or resistance and with a capacitance.
10:57
But we are not going to be looking at how to build these other gates.
11:03
This is just to give you an intuition of what are the basics of these electric models so
11:07
that we can understand what happens at the higher level when we are building the circuits.
11:14
But all the types of gates can be represented using more complex versions of these model by adding more elements into it.
11:18
So as I was saying, here we have the switch and the model and now we can look at the resistance capacitance model where we have the zero,
11:29
but here we have the one and we have to zero as the input voltage.
11:39
And then at some point I remember, as I said, this is a continuous model.
11:44
We have a kind of knob on the input so that the result on the output voltage is going to change gradually over time.
11:48
Thus we have this curve over here. So here we have a zero.
12:00
Here we have a one. Here we have a zero. But then the question becomes, what value is in this range over here?
12:05
We're going to take you to one, because it's not exactly down here, but we're going to take you to zero because it's not exactly up here.
12:16
So what we are going to say is that this is some intermediate value that we just cannot tell whether
12:24
it's a boolean zero or one when we are looking at the voltage of this circuit or of these gate.
12:32
So, in fact, what we are going to do is this critize the analogue domain of the electronic design and to some arbitrary value.
12:42
So in this case, we chose arbitrarily. It could be according to your design, it could be different values.
12:54
But in this case, in this example, we are going to say that anything that is one point seven balls and above,
13:00
we are going to assume it's logic one and anything that is underneath or below zero point five balls, we are going to treat it as a logic zero.
13:06
And as I was saying, everything that falls in between is just an unknown value, we cannot really tell.
13:22
And this is how we are converting that the physical implementation,
13:30
which is analogue because basically we do have electrons that are doing the work for us and they work in an analogue world,
13:34
which is the same we live in.
13:42
But by doing this this great decision, we can transform this analogue world into a digital world of ones and zeros that has no noise,
13:44
because as you can see here all, most of the time, this value of voltage here that we are representing a zero or as one, it's not fixed.
13:54
It's going to be going up and down.
14:05
But as long as it stays within the band that we consider one, it's going to look as a stable logic,
14:09
one on the digital world, even though it's not stable on the physical or analogue world.
14:16
And this is how we are with the digital circuits we abstract away from these analogue world.
14:22
Just in case you're curious, some examples on when this happens is because, for example,
14:30
your voltage source or your battery will not always give a constant voltage, but also circuits or other gates nearby.
14:34
Switching between zeros and ones are going to create additional fields, electromagnetic fields that will affect you.
14:43
So this is why these analogue values on voltage are never stable.
14:50
And we need to use this current approach on the voltage to bring it back into the digital world, which is the one we want to work with.
14:56
So as I was just saying, there's a noise margin, which in this case we just decided arbitrarily to be one point seven balls for,
15:06
for example, and anything above one point seven.
15:15
We will describe as one and everything below zero point five.
15:19
We will describe as a boolean or logic zero.
15:24
Now, the dean here is to design circuits so that they will operate with enough space between this threshold.
15:28
So whenever we want to represent a Boolean one, we will operate with voltages that are clearly all the time about one point seven.
15:38
And when we want to operate with a Boolean zero, we are going to design circuits that are clearly way below the zero point five threshold.
15:46
Now, the question is, how do we determine these as we are building circuits?
15:55
So the way we can understand this problem is using potential dividers.
16:01
And this is easier understood with a variable resistance model.
16:07
So here we have the voltage that we saw in before in the previous diagrams, then we have the resistance of the source, the voltage source.
16:13
This would be the variable resistance that remember the not that we used to go from one to zero.
16:28
And then this would be the resistance of of of the load of the rest of the circuit.
16:35
Remember, what is the resistance that is brought by all the other gates in the circuit?
16:43
So now what we can do here, and this is knowledge that you will probably remember from school when looking at electronic designs,
16:52
is that we can simplify this into one single resistance,
17:03
the total resistance using this formula over here, just adding up, one divided by each one of the elements will be one divided by total resistance.
17:08
And then we can play with the formula of the voltage by saying that the output voltage, which is final at the very end of the day,
17:19
what we care about to make sure that it's within the thresholds that we set that represent a clear one or clear zero,
17:31
we can calculate this using this formula over here.
17:40
We are by taking the source of the resistance and the total resistance in to these two places here and the input voltage officer.
17:44
And with this, we can check whether we are doing it right to have the ones and zeros in the according to the
17:54
one point seven volts threshold and the zero point five thresholds for the these ones and zeros.
18:03
So if we now put in some real numbers on this example, let's see what the results would be.
18:11
So for both the one and zero logic values, we will have a fixed source resistance of in this example, one thousand homes.
18:19
Then the load of the load resistance is also fixed.
18:31
It's the rest of the circuit and this is, let's say, 10000 homes.
18:37
And basically what we can play with is the resistance, the variable resistance, which is what I said, the knob.
18:43
When the knob is all turned on to get that logic, one, we will have three thousand homes.
18:49
And when it's turned all the way down to have a zero A, we are going to say that this resistance has 60 homes.
18:56
So we that we apply the formula that we just saw. We calculate the total resistance, which is this to Valiums over here.
19:05
And with this, we can finally calculate what the output voltage, which is what we are going to use to represent either one's or zero's.
19:12
So in this case, it's three point five volts for the logic, one that we won over here.
19:20
So now we look back into the table that we had.
19:29
Three point five is well. Above the one point seven margin, so we are good.
19:33
This is clearly a boolean one.
19:41
And then for the output voltage, we have zero point twenty eight volts, which we go back to what we established, it's clearly.
19:46
Below zero point five. So we are good.
19:58
This is clearly a zero, which is exactly what we wanted to have,
20:01
this analogue varying signals clearly within the one and zero thresholds that we predefined.
20:05
OK, so once we have this example now, let's look at what happens when we put more Gates together.
20:16
So remember that we can put multiple in this case.
20:25
Let's use, for example, an engaged in here and we can connect them together.
20:31
Let's say this comes from somewhere else and we connect them together in serious.
20:37
Like this, and then each of them, it's going to have its source come with an input.
20:44
And that is all fine because there's no problems here.
20:54
We will just get the signal going through as expected.
21:00
Now, the problem and that this is what it's called fun out is what happens when we connect this one gate out.
21:04
Finding out into multiple other gates.
21:14
And in this case, once we have a parallel circuit, which is what this is basically.
21:20
Having all these gates over here, they are having.
21:27
The voltage over here, and this means that the voltage coming out of here has to be distributed out into the multiple gates.
21:32
This is why it's called it's called find out. It's fanning out into multiple gates that we are feeding with the same input gates.
21:43
Now, this can become a problem, as we will see, because at the end of the day,
21:51
this is represented as having the remember, this was the Arnold with each one of these gates.
21:57
Four would have its own resistance, and this is altogether is what we were writing down as our load in the previous slides.
22:04
So now let's see what happens when we put ten of them.
22:17
So if we take the formula that we already knew to calculate the total resistance,
22:22
we will have the that the output voltage is two point one for the logic one, and it's zero point twenty seven for the logic zero.
22:27
Now, if we go back to that graph that we have. In here.
22:38
Let me delete the previous annotations now we have two point one as the output voltage of the whole circuit and, uh, zero point let me check again.
22:44
Twenty eight. Is that right?
22:56
No. Zero point twenty seven, sorry.
23:02
Zero point twenty seven over here in the zero, it's still clearly below, but in the range of one, this is not so far away from each other anymore.
23:07
So we are getting dangerously close to the point that the variability,
23:19
the analogue variability in the circuit, in the voltage could lead this to fall down into this area.
23:24
If we are really close, that voltage line could drop down inside the indeterminate area.
23:35
And then we really cannot call this a correct implementation for the logic circuit because we cannot tell you that zero or one anymore.
23:42
So, as you can see out can become a problem when designing circuits because we are decreasing the operating voltage.
23:54
So the more gates that we connect together, we find out into from one gate that could if it's too large,
24:03
it could lead to a decrease in the voltage to a point where we can no longer tell what the boolean value is.
24:13
And this is, in fact a problem that appears when designing.
24:21
Chips, more complex chips, so now we can look at the same problem from the other way around here,
24:26
we have again we have our input voltage of five volts, we have our source resistance,
24:34
and we want to see what the total resistance needs to be so that the output voltage will be one point seven because remember,
24:44
whatever its one point seven or below, we just don't know what the value is.
24:55
So once we find this limit, we know once we have this total resistance here, then we can do the second part of the problem,
25:00
which is calculating how many load resistance we can put together that so that the total resistance would be this very over here.
25:09
So basically, it's going to tell us what the maximum value that we can have and still keep the
25:20
logic values that the threshold that we want to have the proper logic value.
25:27
So remember, in this case, we said arbitrarily there is one point seven.
25:35
So I'm going to stop for a minute. You can take a pen and paper and using the formulas that we just calculate first,
25:40
what would be the total resistance that leads to one point seven on the output?
25:47
And then from that calculate or estimate, what would be the maximum?
25:51
Find out that we could read until we go into failure and we can no longer tell William.
25:56
OK, so I hope that you post the video. Now let's look at the solutions.
26:06
So the first one, we simply apply the formulas that we already saw.
26:12
So if we take the input values, we hunt for the source input voltage and the output voltage where we will start seeing failures,
26:17
we can, uh, as I said, the voltage.
26:28
We can then isolate what's the total resistance? And the result is approximately 500 homes.
26:32
Now, if we take these five hundred homes over here, we can using the formula that we already sold to calculate the total resistance.
26:40
When we have a parallel circuit with the multiple gates finding out, then we can look at what is this load over here knowing that we have.
26:51
The political resistance here for the one and we come up with a resistance of north of 10000,
27:05
so what we're going to have is that each of the gates is going to be a portion of that.
27:16
So with this, we can take ten thousand divided by six hundred.
27:23
And that gives us that the number of gates that we can have in here is up to 17.
27:27
So if we do 17 or more gates, we will stop having valid boolean values on the output voltage and we will no
27:34
longer be able to tell whether the output voltage corresponds to a one or a zero.
27:43
Because we are in this indeterminate area whenever we have less than these 17 gates fanning out from a single input gate,
27:50
we are safe and we are within operating margins.
28:00
Now, another problem of large crowds is that they also increase the delay of the circuit,
28:05
and this is because the of the increases in the load capacities.
28:13
So these circuits that we were looking at, they as I was just saying, they also have a capacitance and it's in parallel.
28:20
Basically, you can think of it, as you already probably know from school,
28:31
is that a capacitors take a while to load up with enough electrons so that they can jump through to the next plate in the condenser and the capacitor.
28:38
So the more we have in parallel, the longer it takes for all of them to be charged enough to trigger a jump.
28:51
So basically, this is because the electrons are being divided within between on the capacitors.
29:01
So this means that if we have one single gate over here, this is going to load relatively fast.
29:06
But if we have many more gates over here, all the output needs to be distributed amongst them.
29:13
And they will, in average, all together as a group, take longer for all of them to be properly loaded.
29:21
So just to summarise, we see that whenever we have a large fallout's, this can lead to problems in these and we can either lose the values,
29:29
the boolean values that we want and we are going back to the world, which is exactly what we want to not do with digital circuits.
29:41
And also, even if even when we are within the proper margins, we are all still increasing the delay of the circuit.
29:52
So in fact, in industry, when designing a large tubes, this is a very big concern.
30:02
Many chip designers will try to reduce the fun out as much as they can in order to avoid exactly
30:11
these problems running into an indeterminate value or increasing the delay of the circuit.
30:21
And the way in which they usually do that is by replicating circuits.
30:27
So something that could be shared and then between many other circuits and then
30:32
it's all output fed into multiple other circuits that could use that value.
30:39
What we will often see in real world designs is that this piece or module of the circuit is going to be replicated in order to avoid
30:44
large funnels because in some cases it's better to pay us an additional bit in area if in exchange we can still maintain the,
30:56
of course, the true will and values that we want from the circuit.
31:07
But also it's worth paying somewhere if we can reduce the latency of the circuit.
31:11
So we thought we reached the end of the first part of this lecture and on the next part we
31:19
will look at what are the implications when we are designing digital circuits with these.
31:26
We'll see you in the next part.
31:33
