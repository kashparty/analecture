Title: DoCSoc - Introduction to Programming Utilities (2 of 3) - Q&A - Linux
Category: COMP 1st Year General
Lecturer: Konstantinos Gkoutzis
Date: 07/10/2021
So let's talk about the basics of Linux and was out today talking about text editors and pilots and in the process is
0:00
down in the process of show how to work on the department machines from your own machine quite nicely using Vaskov.
0:16
Well, explain what Vaska is and stuff like that as well.
0:28
So, um, I'm going to start off by installing this code and then I will talk a bit about it again, because they're going to be useful.
0:33
But yeah, for now, I have a machine with a cell installed and I think it already has JHC.
0:44
So I will switch back to the machine to demonstrate how the installation for that a bit later, so.
0:53
Yes, code pretty simple. And you want to go to the code and if you're running on Linux, you can also download it here as well.
1:02
I'm obviously on Windows and I'm not going to be downloading it inside and inside of it.
1:16
So explain how this sort of works between them when it's up and running and.
1:23
Oh. Oh, cool, so I didn't it and then we can trap about what it is, why I'm recommending it and how to use it.
1:32
So. Here it is, yes, they are myself and I'm going to.
1:49
Close this so that we're in a fragile environment.
2:01
OK, so welcome to the East Coast. So this is basically a text that is tough and it's not an idea.
2:06
So it's nothing particularly fancy, but it does allow you to.
2:21
And it added, quote, And crucially allows you to work within yourself as well.
2:28
And. Well, it's actually already installed that for me now it's going to be like.
2:35
I thought uninstalling whole thing would have uninstalled the whole thing. Apparently not so.
2:45
OK, so this is sort of the base, the base Vaskov roughly.
2:51
So I can make new files and, you know.
2:56
So I said, OK, so one of the things is that it has and storage and.
3:10
I think I have yet so by default,
3:16
there's only a few languages that does syntax highlighting forward recognise it based on based on the type of phone that it is.
3:20
So I have got to file isn't going to be syntax highlighted by default,
3:30
but it will it will tell you you can go to the marketplace here and find extensions that work with Haskell.
3:35
So if you just want syntax highlighting this one is the way to go.
3:42
But just to Saddam, you can also use this one, which will actually get Verdasco language together with that for now,
3:47
because I'm not currently running anything within a cell. But this is quite good.
3:55
If you want. I'd like features with Haskell. I'm just going to go with the syntax highlighting one thing now because it's less up.
4:00
So I haven't done that. This has now got syntax going to make it bigger as well.
4:08
So, you know, we've got colouring so we can now write files and this is actually getting in the way.
4:14
There it is, so you can also open tells NPR's code as well.
4:28
So there you go.
4:33
There's a window Panopto terminal and it will sort of open in the same place where this trial has been created, which is in Cedar Rapids.
4:34
Jamie. So it's quite useful to basically work in the terminal while you're writing code about it.
4:42
Now, this is what will happen if you were just using windows.
4:49
Now, I recommended yesterday not to just use windows.
4:56
Can you run through without installing the compiler? No.
5:01
You do need to install a compiler somewhere, even if you can do the running inside code with the IAEA so it could be properly installed.
5:05
So yesterday I recommended using a cell phone.
5:15
So I'm going to show you why I'm recommending this code in particular.
5:22
And I'm not sure about Visual Studio on its, um.
5:29
But yeah, it's a pretty similar I mean, for sure.
5:35
The passcode does what most studios have.
5:41
I'm not sure if it's just sort of more specifically targeted C++ and such things that I can't remember is that in a very, very long time.
5:45
Right. So the key thing for us is the remote.
5:56
So there are two remote extensions by Microsoft that are going to be very, very important.
6:02
So I'm going to install the website one first and we'll see what that does.
6:08
So the remote extension allows you to use Vaskov on Windows while working within Linux.
6:13
So what does that mean? Well, you see here we've got this little Green Arrow is pointing at each other and it's obviously not the same.
6:21
So this is like visual studio that's more bulky. The code is a lightweight text editor.
6:34
And. So there has to be a certain tolerance to install that, and I'm not too sure I have to look at that in particular,
6:42
I can remember what happened when I tried to install house language server itself to work with this code,
6:55
but I can try to figure that out in a lab or something.
7:04
So these little green out there, great.
7:08
So when you do that, you get this little box to the top.
7:12
So one is just opening a new window, which we can also open a folder NWSL.
7:17
Now that brings up your iPhone selector, but you can see here just about it's running in that with all of them to distribution.
7:26
So that's my area, right?
7:39
So here are all the things I've got lying around, I'm kind of reluctant to go to possibly high school because it is terrifying.
7:41
But, yeah, these are these are the photos I have in my lyrics distribution.
7:50
And so just, you know, not to scare people with a bunch of high code.
7:56
I'm just going to try to pass on it in the background.
8:00
What could possibly go wrong in the playground?
8:06
So you can see what's happening here is this opening the remote, so the kid's got to install the server inside of a cell to allow it to work.
8:09
And then, yes, I do trust this particular folder. So I'm using computers.
8:20
No. One, this machine is using the other one.
8:26
I do have to learn as well. And I think that would be, you know, using distro.
8:30
And I could pick my one, but someone will find the name for this.
8:38
So basically, I've now got my editor and I now have this folder,
8:44
which is the one that opened the school playground, and I now have the ability to navigate it and things like that.
8:52
So this is a high school project. It is all there. And if I open things up, you see, I don't have the highlights anymore.
9:00
So the way this works is that if you want to have the Haskell syntax highlighting,
9:09
you have to install it within yourself instance and so of balance to that within yourself as well.
9:15
So you can say it's got local and it's also got the things that are installed NWSL.
9:24
So if I go back to that file now. It should be Syntex highlighted great.
9:30
So the beauty of this is, is that I am now editing this file is editing it on my Linux partition within Windows, so I'm not having Windows.
9:37
And if I open a terminal this time, you will see it is running a Linux terminal.
9:49
And, you know, that is a proper Linux terminal. This isn't a Windows terminal.
9:56
So this is why I recommend using this code, because if you're using a cell, you can work within us to this is terminal and edit the code,
10:02
even windows, so you don't have to fiddle around with command line text editors.
10:14
And so that is what I recommend. That's that's step one.
10:18
So you will always have to tell you anything here on WSO ability.
10:22
And I do have ghc I installed in in here so, you know, I can do stuff in this terminal.
10:29
I don't think I can load this project because it will require a hydroxy version.
10:39
But that's okay. So.
10:44
That's the sort of basics, you know, you can you can play around with and with things to find out what the shortcuts are is a question I like to use,
10:49
which is control out and then go up and down, allow you to actually make multiple courses, which can sometimes be useful.
11:02
So finding those is quite nice. So which instructions need to install?
11:12
So is the one I saw.
11:17
I installed the Haskell syntax highlighting here, but you might want to install the Haskell language server and get that stuff out.
11:20
They don't do that at the end of the session. If I got time, see how it works.
11:30
I think for sure you want to yourself extension, can you short-handed the other stuff so you can run the code?
11:35
Yeah. So I will do that the just after I've finished covering this and we will go to my out of the machine and set up Haskell.
11:43
I'm going to show. And.
11:52
What was to do the Haskell platform version, and then depending on whether that works nicely or not,
11:58
I will do the cheapest way of doing things, which is my preferred way of doing it and.
12:05
So you can sort of do what it says, no disturbance that I might look at that in person,
12:16
if you let me know in the lab and I can try and figure out why that might be so important.
12:25
Extension's basically remote, I think is the most important extension that you're going to need if you're using that yourself.
12:31
And so that's that is that basically for working with the NWSL concisely,
12:41
there's another extension I do want to talk about, which is the remote access extension.
12:51
This one's a bit more involved, but it's like the extension.
12:58
Except it allows you to work viruses and so.
13:06
This one is a yeah, it's a bit it's a bit more involved, set it up.
13:15
So that's what I want to go through now, because I think it's very useful.
13:18
This will allow you to work on lap machines. Such extensions would be useful for Mac and.
13:22
So as I say, but I think it's a bit trickier to set up, so I'd recommend capitulations for him for that.
13:30
I think he might talk about how to do that or [INAUDIBLE] talk about what things you should be doing on Mac in particular.
13:38
And I think the steps that he took here didn't work for some people on Mac last year.
13:45
So proceed with caution. Yeah, as I said, extension allows you to work on another machine virus.
13:53
Now that will include machines. So I want to show how to get that working.
14:02
So I'm going to close this remote connexion and I'll show you what's changed.
14:09
And I got Sustagen. So when I open this door to green, it's now I get the same ones I had before about new windows opening folds out and so on,
14:15
but I've also got these remote S.H. versions as well.
14:28
So the important thing to start with is opening the config file.
14:33
So the config file is going to be important because it's going to different aliases.
14:40
So I mentioned this yesterday, but I didn't show what they were essentially by giving a name to something,
14:45
you can basically make it so you can just type in that thing without having to type out the whole long form.
14:53
So as an example, I could call show one hostname is show one dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot UK and my username is HWB for one night.
15:00
So if I just have this saved, if I open a Windows terminal because this has been created in windows,
15:17
if I can just share one I can get into show one without typing my username and the whole address and ubiquitous.
15:26
I don't have an key up on that server.
15:34
So that is what we're going to do next because you need to generate a Windows Asus HKT to hop in by the barcode extension.
15:38
And so I'm going to show that process and get this done on its own.
15:51
So once we've got one of the subjects, I just want to show what this is going to end up looking like.
15:55
So if I connect to host, you'll see that it's not a hostname up here so I can now connect to show one.
16:00
And it is a Linux platform. I'm forced to enter my password.
16:10
And, um, and it will set up an S.H. host on show one, so this will allow me to be browsing.
16:16
It's not ideal. You don't really want to be watching the show machines, but what it's done,
16:25
hopefully I can illustrate why you want, as I say, each case in particular that's opening.
16:31
So. And that's fine.
16:39
OK, so we are in that. So if I open the folder, you can see this is my home for one month.
16:45
So this is my home directory on the department's machines.
16:54
And I can go in and I can open one of these things in here.
17:01
I say, for instance, this. Now, here's the issue, you start to see it, I don't type in my password twice,
17:07
I'm going to have to type in my password many more times as I keep using this just
17:18
sort of every now and then you can ask me for my password since it's just not ideal.
17:24
So in an ideal world, you don't want to do this, but this is actually the directory writing on the Tomlins machine.
17:29
It gets collected by is going to be here when I make changes and get sent back to the department machines.
17:39
So this is how we can work on department machines, but we're going to get a bit more sophisticated so that we don't have to use passwords and B,
17:46
we can go straight into an ATM machine as opposed to going to shelters.
17:56
So I'm just going to close this connexion and I'm not happy with what just happened, by the way, before we move on to making it work better.
18:01
Everybody outstanding? Yeah, OK, cool. Some people are happy, and if you're not travelling, OK, so back to the associated conflict.
18:12
So essentially what I'm going to add to this is identity file.
18:25
Now, this allows you to specify in this to say so. I'm going to say that it's in the state folder and under the quote at the RSA dock.
18:32
So we need to now going to make the RSA key. So I covered this yesterday.
18:43
I'm getting it in a Windows terminal this time.
18:49
So that's a page taken and it's going to ask me what do I want to collect?
18:53
So I do want to put it that it was not necessary to date as a doc, I'm not going to get a password, just speed today.
19:00
So it has created it. It is in that. So now this should work fine.
19:16
But if I had to say into one. You can still say I have to enter my password, and that's because I haven't registered that key.
19:25
Now, yesterday I showed the how do you get.
19:35
How do you so sorry, how do you get this message out so you've got the remote access extension that displays to get to open a file,
19:40
can we do this within this code so you can use your local installation of GHC and stuff and your local files,
19:50
but you can't get into a machine and sort of work on their files just within the code using an extension.
19:59
So it's better to use the SSA if you want to actually work on the lab machines for whatever reason and stuff.
20:09
Yes. Yesterday I said you can use SNH that copied Ushahidi.
20:18
Now on Windows. That is not a script. So what do we do?
20:24
Well, the good news is we still have WSO.
20:31
So what we can do is we can use, as I say, idea like we did yesterday, but we need to change the location it's working on.
20:36
So I'm going to just fill out my whole name because I don't have access to the big file with it.
20:46
So show one dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot UK and I need to specify an identity file.
20:54
So that's done by Dashti and this time I need to go to the users Jamie DSH and then a RSA talk.
21:01
Won't be around all the way around. OK, so the dashi goes first, the story goes first, and then I for nine at one.
21:17
So here we go. This is the familiar and familiar thing we've seen before.
21:34
So just to remind you, when you're with NWSL. Mount St. Users is the equivalent of the city drive.
21:39
And now it happens that I haven't actually registered with NWSL, so I didn't need to enter my password here, but we can go and check again.
21:51
Can we get into someone without a password? Yes, we can.
22:03
We made it. OK, so. I'll just show you this, come on again and explain what it's doing.
22:06
This is the command, the copy, and this is actually from us here.
22:16
And it sends it to show this username and order here so that I can specify I want the key I just made so that C drive users.
22:21
Jamie, don't get to say I'd say, OK, so the difference between the windows and cell isn't.
22:34
So you use forward such amounts. Yeah, hopefully that makes sense.
22:41
And I could write this up somewhere late. So this is within the WSO terminal, but I'm using it to send my windows, ok.
22:47
What do I need a new key for this because this code is running in windows.
22:56
So yes, I have enough to keep in mind at all in this cell distribution.
23:02
So when I talk, it always gets into the machines without a password.
23:07
But Windows itself could and it can't make use of Linux, DNS, HK.
23:12
I could have copied it and moved it into because this is a folder, but I'm just trying to set one up from from defo.
23:17
So how do you actually generate the key by doing SSA Kaija and then I specified a name because I already have.
23:25
This is HKT, I didn't want to overwrite but you can just sort of press enter and enter and you'll get a key by default.
23:34
So you would say enter and you'll get this your default name and to enter.
23:42
And I copy that. Come on in chat. Of course.
23:50
Which one that is a set keychain is obvious in itself.
23:54
So let's chat those chat and.
24:01
So that's probably what it be for you, um.
24:22
So, yes, you had a password for the certificate. You have to put in that every time, it depends.
24:29
So I think sometimes they'll get sort of unlocked and put in what's called a keyring.
24:34
I'm not sure if Windows does that by default. It might certainly a buncha more of them do well.
24:40
So you'll only have to enter in your password once that login and then you'll be able to use it again and again without that.
24:47
So, yes, and generating a key, but then it's generating key within windows and then copying it to the servers using Excel.
24:55
And just because William doesn't have the copy at the SSA command,
25:08
it's a it's Olympic's, it's an intense programme, so I have to use doubles yourselves.
25:15
Appreciate it. Of course, you can also association and I copy be in the public key, but that's just a bit more annoying.
25:20
OK, so with that done, I can get into Shel.
25:31
What was the step after watching the phone line? Yes, that was that was SNH Keija.
25:37
So if you've already got a key in windows that you can skip out and just use that key, if you don't, that's what you want in a command prompt.
25:45
So an. After copying key to show one person tonight, you probably put your password wrong if if you've got permission denied to just try again.
25:54
So that's show one. Uh, next, we actually want to go to a laboratory.
26:09
Now, I'm going to just pick a specific lab machine. And the machine that comes to mind for me is Texel 07.
26:14
So what's the hardest thing to test that tech? So I just have a dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
26:25
OK, what's my username? That's the same as before.
26:33
I'm going to use the same identity file. Now I'll explain the next bit because it changes things a little.
26:38
So this you'd think may be able to get into Texel now if you tried this.
26:50
So I can save this and let's see what happens if I trying to change the text.
26:58
So I try not to a seven. Nothing happens.
27:06
And so what's the reason? Nothing happens. The reason is that it takes a little sudden and is not visible to the outside world.
27:12
So like I said yesterday, that machines aren't visible outside of an imperial network.
27:25
Now, one way to address this is to have your head of the Imperial VPN.
27:32
Really, if you have the Imperial began running, then you could access ancient attacks like this.
27:37
It would be fine. I don't have the people riding on this machine, so I have to do an extra step now, no matter what we say.
27:44
Association to touchdown first, right? Once you're inside Shell, you can exercise anywhere else.
27:54
Now you can use a proxy command to do that. So in Windows, what is attached on windows you want to see on live?
28:00
So if you're actually running on empty or that if you're running a Mac, you shouldn't be in this room.
28:12
But just in case, just keep us.
28:18
So just this on windows, you can access it. And then there's going to be some parameters.
28:23
I will paste into the chat once and I will explain a little bit about what they are.
28:30
But I'm not entirely sure what the flags Zerega, I think at this hour.
28:36
So roughly this is they take the hostname and the port the port is by default, pretty cool.
28:41
And all this proxy in is doing is basically saying if you try and get into Texel, do it by first getting into show one.
28:49
So that's what this that's what this means. And I can pop this in the chat so that people can use it.
28:58
Here we go. So essentially this is saying, Axel, we're going for show one first.
29:08
So let's see if this works. First off. And I'm in right now, and I used my key to go through Shell into Texel,
29:15
so that's the steps you can take if you have to do again, you don't need to worry about the box to come on.
29:27
But I mean, they probably won't hurt either way. Basically is the coffee machine rather than a specific one.
29:31
Excellent question. Yeah. Could you get into the machine?
29:40
And unfortunately, the answer is, I don't know, you might be able to do it by, uh, making the Proxicom jump into Shell one script.
29:44
I don't actually know how to do it if you don't have the proximity commands that you got into Taxila seven.
29:55
That means you're running in the Imperial VPN or you're running on an imperial machine or any parallel network.
30:05
If you can be in the labs, for instance, it will work.
30:14
But could you get inside Imperial if you're in your actual house and you're not running the VPN and then you will need the proxy command?
30:17
Um, OK. So I'm in fact so cool. They got proof I was actually in Texel, so now I've got this stuff.
30:26
So I've got my, my, my keys set up. I've got my proxy and the Taxol.
30:34
Let's see if it works. So can I go next to Texel as the host?
30:39
It is a mixed platform and I'm in it.
30:44
So you can see here editing on SNH Texel Ozalp.
30:49
Great. And so I can open a folder, let's open documents.
30:53
And I guess what I'll do is I'll make a new directory to play around with a pretty big directory and OK.
31:02
And what we will do is we will go to the doctor.
31:14
So you better mind what I'm going to say.
31:20
What I mean, the same extension I'm actually physically editing this terminal window is on the department machines, which is kind of cool.
31:22
It can open up docs. Is it possible for multiple people to access one computer at once?
31:34
Yes. Yes, it is enjoyable.
31:40
You can find the first names. I don't know.
31:44
And I sort of just remember them because I've been in the lab and I've seen their names, but I'm sure yeah, you can find some.
31:47
I think someone's put a link to it. OK, so if that's open.
31:55
So we're currently working I think and yeah.
32:02
The docs. OK, ok. So I cannot make a new file. I'm going to.
32:05
Thankfully, have Haskell, yeah. So let's let's just try writing a Haskell file and check that it actually does work.
32:13
Well, OK, I don't want to implement them, but right now that one is laptop and this to cool.
32:29
So let's call this fact not a chance.
32:43
And it's over time. So, see, we're running in the folder.
32:49
Can we open that up? Just. Yes, we can, apparently.
32:54
I don't know how to code today, but I got so drunk and I can now use the toilet for that five and so on.
33:02
And remember, this is running on the lab machines rather than proxy command.
33:11
Can you possibly. I think that microphone issues when I tried it last year, I'm not entirely sure.
33:16
It might just work out fine. So, yeah, so this is, you know, how we could work on of machines.
33:23
It does seem to be a little bit more brittle than just working on a cell. So, yeah, you'll get some people who just can't connect by that.
33:33
And the passwords to the passwords that it asks when get security is, you'll give us the password.
33:44
So that is basically allowing you to log into the university machine.
33:51
So what you've walked into the university machine that you can put the key in, then you don't need the password.
33:56
Yeah, so if you are getting retools, temporary untrainable or various other things, I'm not entirely sure.
34:05
So if you were actually on a love machine, but this would be the same. Well, if you look at that machine, you could just have Vaskov.
34:13
Right. And you could just work locally. You wouldn't need so you wouldn't need psychiatric extension.
34:20
You'd just be running on that Linux machine or Atim, I think is also installed on those machines.
34:25
So you wouldn't need to go through all of this. This is if you want to work in a machine that specifically is if you want to get into the labs.
34:34
And the extension is if you want to work on those that still use Linux, which is, I suggested, supported mode of operation.
34:42
If you're just using Linux, you can install code and you don't need the extension,
34:50
just work, but you need the extension to get into the laps of the House config file again.
34:57
Yes, I can. And here it is.
35:04
I will make a post about this probably on the first year, and I'm just sort of demonstrate that later on today.
35:12
So I don't feel like I need to write it all down practically.
35:19
Yeah, you can also find information about them online.
35:25
OK, so with that all out the way, I want to install GHC, unless there's any questions about this,
35:34
is there any point in setting up SAHD if we cannot work on at least a while?
35:41
You don't need a nexus key for the lab machines.
35:47
No, but for you kids, you probably won't notice HP, so you better believe I'm going to be covering it to the kids again tomorrow.
35:49
Because when we get in tomorrow's train, which is very, very important tomorrow,
35:59
because everything I get if you don't use is actually there, you're going to have to enter your password when you want to push your car.
36:05
So it gets very annoying. So I recommend setting up a safe case, even if you don't put them on the dock.
36:14
So you need to look for other things. But you know a lot of services now, then you might want to get inside.
36:20
OK, so any other questions about this stuff?
36:29
Is it working? I'll be able to help you with this.
36:32
Just let me know. But anyone who has got any questions about this, if we get to the end,
36:36
I'll come back and see if we can that Haskell Haskell language server on this machine and we'll see what happens.
36:44
But this is all on one sort of basic technology for now on this code.
36:51
And I should also probably show, you know what, I'll, uh, before we leave this machine, which is my go to terminal text choice and,
36:57
you know, just in case of time for anyone else asking questions if they have them, if not, OK.
37:11
OK, I'll take that as no more questions.
37:25
So, Anana, so this code is great every now and then you just want to add something very quickly and you don't want to have to OpenBSD code,
37:29
get into the cell, find the blindfold, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
37:38
So there are a few different editors. You'll probably be more familiar with the term stuff like Emacs then.
37:43
I like Leno because it's just the simplest one of all that's going to demonstrate how that works.
37:52
Well. Xanana has a very simple interface.
38:00
It does have a few short khakis at the bottom.
38:04
You can you can look at. I'm worried about too much.
38:08
Most of the time, you just want to edit and text, which you can do when you want to see the final.
38:13
You would use control. Oh, and it will ask you what's the phone?
38:21
Right. I'm just going to say enter because I've got it.
38:24
And I'll tell you that it's one line to control to that and then control X is for getting the [INAUDIBLE] out of it.
38:28
So they go right out of control and exit is control.
38:36
So yes, that is basically the basics of Nannar. That's all I want to show you about.
38:44
And then I just show you it's there. It's very easy to just edit things basic.
38:48
And so can you open up the whole terminal?
38:54
Absolutely. Code dot text.
38:58
Uh, kuris not found. I think you'll see a lot of text.
39:04
Actually do this, you can you can do this somehow.
39:11
I've just forgotten how so I think you are able to actually open things from inside that terminal.
39:20
I think maybe I've had this happen before I installed Fiasco's and I go to a place and set it up in the playground at night.
39:26
So you definitely can I think you just have to work out where both codes and command actually like executable is that will open in windows,
39:42
but it will automatically launch the extension as a vehicle to do is expose the dot and then,
39:53
you know, say open with code is code and you'll see it's open to that.
40:04
And it has actually opened open thinking that hasn't stopped its open windows.
40:15
But yeah, there are ways to do it. I've just forgotten for the time being, so.
40:22
Yeah, so hopefully the text actually works, that would certainly work and apologies if you're just using Moulinex that work.
40:30
And let me just quickly, because it might be because this is still one terminal,
40:38
I'm just going to close them down and open one up again just in case code.
40:44
How many Texas potentially at 240. OK, so I had to restart the show, I think I had outcome when I still installed it.
40:55
So yeah, what was it called? Code of text.
41:03
Let's see in action did open. You can see it is opening in about.
41:10
And and yet there you go, that's actually your text, that's the one we've been using.
41:17
So people are saying that and if we go back, catalogue text, it indeed has it in there.
41:25
So, yeah, you can open things by just using code. And if you want to open the entire folder, for instance, it a dot.
41:36
Oh, I was in the wrong place and code of text open in the proper location.
41:45
Guilty as the rest of the time, Jamie.
41:56
And as I said, if I time between here, that is going to be my Linux terminal in that directory.
42:02
Cat text is to be allowed in that.
42:10
Can I show the Cabal config? And so I'm not sure exactly what you mean by the Cabala conflict, but I will now go through how to install Haskell.
42:15
So we'll go through that now. Any have questions about this stuff, because I need to switch machine because I need a machine without hassle sold.
42:31
It's not OK with me.
42:47
Stop staring here and let me switch machine.
42:51
This is seamless. Um, so what's this game for keyboarder about other teams terminal?
42:58
Just great and it's just great.
43:09
So I think I want screen too, because I think it's slightly bigger. Uh, can I go and see this?
43:13
OK. Yeah, cool.
43:20
So today I'm going to do my best to install GHC from scratch,
43:24
so first that so I'm going to show I think the note suggested using a student apt install Haskell platform.
43:35
I think this will probably work fine for most people. So this would all be all that you run essentially on a Linux thing.
43:45
Hopefully this works out fine for everyone.
43:56
And however, if you have problems with that or you want a bit more control over GHC, I'm going to go through an alternative way of doing it.
43:58
And so trying to avoid all of my tabs.
44:09
Yeah. GHC up. So I'm going to go with the GDC is the task, all sorts of manager.
44:14
And what may show in terms of your reasoning. I'm using Windows terminal so if I open the store I'll show you exactly what I mean.
44:26
So it is the Windows terminal. This one here, and it consolidates everything in one place so I can still open my power shell in here and stuff,
44:37
so it's just it's just sort of a way of combining all of my things all in one place.
44:48
So this is what I recommend using. It's very pretty. Yeah.
44:55
So you can't locate the Haskell platform package you might need to consider up to date.
45:01
So step one. Let's try and get a black screen because my terminals are slightly transparent.
45:07
And so out of date is the first thing we want to be doing.
45:15
Just that we can get the most up to date package lists what you've got and try and do the back from again.
45:19
And if it works great, if not, then follow along with this.
45:27
So this is basically the Haskell community's answer to the horrific install experience that used to have.
45:34
So I'm going to show this so it has a quick install and.
45:43
You basically just run a command on the terminal. Now we've got here Linux, Mac OS three, this in order to specifically do so.
45:50
If you work with one, you're going to have to make extensive arrangements.
45:59
But for two, we have to do this so we can just copy this.
46:03
And I'm just going to run it in the terminal. So need to paste up to open the Windows terminal.
46:08
You have one of your bunji distributions on this scanner. Otherwise, if you're just typing, WUIS will do it as well.
46:16
Let me just quickly show that. So if I run yourself, oops, that gets me into yourself.
46:24
So this is the commander interested in running. Now, what is this command all about?
46:35
Basically, this is tool for and stuff from the web.
46:40
So this is basically going to get Gizzi up and it's fetching the script and it's piping.
46:44
Remember, we talked about pipes a little bit yesterday.
46:50
It's piping the output of the script it fetches into S.H., which basically is just running a script without a script and running it basically.
46:53
So if we run it, let's see what happens. Carol is not found great.
47:03
So I've tried to make this distribution as blank as possible in the hope that
47:08
I can show all of the things that could possibly go wrong with the process.
47:15
So I'm going to install Cuttle, just as it says it has not found count install pseudo actors, although I'm running pseudo actors.
47:20
Talk how it's going to install colour for me.
47:29
We all get it. So let's try and run the script again.
47:33
So you can see that make a bit smaller, so saying welcome, the script is going to download and install the following things up itself,
47:39
the about Stack and potentially the Haskell language server.
47:50
So I'm not sure if that will just automatically integrate the voice code.
47:54
If you do it this way, it might do it worth a shot.
47:58
We'll see what happens if you can just sort of uninstall them by Al Jazeera.
48:02
That works. So antidepressive controls to about that same time.
48:08
It asks, do I want to add it to my variable so that I can use it in the terminal?
48:15
Yes, you probably want that. It doesn't really matter. You prepend up and we'll go with P.
48:20
Do you want to install Haskell language? I'm going to say no for now. Just quickness.
48:26
But you compared with saying yes to this and seeing what happens.
48:31
So it says that it can integrate within the next voice, code, atem, etc.
48:36
So this could be a step to actually enabling some to say no to Panopto just to make this process a bit faster.
48:41
Do I want to install Spack? I think you do want to install STAC. I think that's what Tony seems to use.
48:50
So we'll do that.
48:56
So it's not going to start downloading stuff is not going to tell you that the following packages need to be installed before continuing.
48:58
So the school here.
49:07
So I'm going to copy those, I'm going to control the outlets and I'm going to run through that and install all of these things right now.
49:11
It's important that you don't see the update, otherwise Saddam won't be found.
49:21
So make sure you update this one. This is going to say it's installing a bunch of stuff.
49:26
We'll wait for that to happen. It's not going to all of those packages that they will that get installed.
49:33
Again, nothing to do. But I already instructed that up to date versions.
49:43
So once you've got these all in place and remember, JCA is going to tell you what these are.
49:48
So don't worry about voting them down or whatever. Like I said, the bottom is going to tell you about them and let's run it again.
49:55
And yeah. So we're happy to proceed. Yes, and that doesn't sort of installed back, so now it's going to get to work and again,
50:05
it's going to help you please ensure that these packages are now installed.
50:17
We have just ensured that these packages are installed, all of these things here.
50:21
So we're happy to proceed and we're just going to wait for it to download and install all of the things.
50:26
So we'll wait for that to happen. And it might take some time.
50:34
It's quite big, it's got to be deep before people install eight point ten point seven, which is a reasonable model.
50:40
One, I think the Haskell platform going for something in eight point eight, which is a bit older.
50:47
So it doesn't really matter which one it was up here doing.
50:53
Was the command of the studio up to date? So that would have been the command from Jessica, so you can find that on the website.
50:58
This one here. And so someone asked about installing windows.
51:10
So how does that compare to the detailed one using Chocolatey?
51:18
Not sure I would avoid installing Haskell on windows.
51:22
That's basically what I'm going to say. I think install processes a bit better for Windows these days.
51:26
But we'll be clear that I was sort of focussed on Linux, so I'd recommend doing it within OS.
51:32
So how do you change the speed test uses the charlena so you can do it by something like this?
51:46
I'm just gonna get another turn quickly to demonstrate. So the way you would get to that place is, uh, forward.
51:53
Slash a. Slash the slash uses and a cleaner.
52:03
However, you probably don't want to work in your windows things.
52:12
So back to work in the home directory. They are separate places.
52:16
It's quite slow to use cell in your windows folders.
52:22
So stick to your Lennix ones. You can always get them to navigate by running explorer DOT on Windows 11.
52:26
He got in Windows 11. It will just belong here. So I would actually like say Linux and show you your distribution's.
52:36
I would stick to your Memex user directory. If you did sit and still has a good platform, nothing worked, is that what you have to do?
52:43
Yes. So this is an alternative way of doing it and it's way it happens.
52:51
And it's going to say JCI is not found so much.
52:59
So it says the reason why. So it says Basanti has been modified.
53:04
Restart your terminal for the changes to take effect or type source, blah, blah, blah.
53:08
You could alternate source docs, Bashar.
53:14
So what is your Bashar? It's basically your configuration for the shell and source.
53:18
Basically just reloads it so special. See, I don't know.
53:24
I can use JHC. And so they go, I'm only eight points up, kind of I want to make changes,
53:28
I can just change that now as a command and it has a bunch of things that you can do.
53:37
Plus, we'll show you all of the different GHC versions that you could install,
53:44
which one you've currently got, which ones you installed and which one using.
53:49
That's to text shows, what version of cable you've got installed,
53:53
one version of stack up and stuff so you can upgrade your things by something like this.
53:58
And still about three point six. And it will go and install them and it's as easy as that.
54:06
So this is why I quite like up, because it allows you to manage these installations a lot more easily than anything else.
54:16
And that's quite important for me, because I tend to jump around GHC versions quite frequently.
54:24
But at the moment, eight point ten point seven is the recommended one.
54:30
So you probably stick with that. So if you're working on someone, this is probably going to fail.
54:34
So someone has some problems with JHC at the moment, with some of the more modern versions.
54:46
So I would expect you to just because you haven't done that.
54:55
And I've always tried using the platform instead of to their instructions to date to it, you find them.
55:00
Let's have a look at yourself to an.
55:14
So. I think that's just a command. Yeah, something like that, a different version to work as long as your Windows 10 is up to date and.
55:23
Yeah, OK, that's a good question. So your default runs in your windows used for that.
55:38
How do I set it open like yours instead of doing c.D thing?
55:42
Great question. It's in the settings. So if you go to the settings and then you go to the one you want to go to see my bunta
55:47
one I can change with the starting directory is so that is my next home directory.
55:55
About, about is the distribution slash time slash Jamie.
56:04
That's myself. So that's how you can set that and that, that really helps.
56:08
What do you think that's pushing the button. So it will be slower than so.
56:18
I don't have much experience with virtual machines.
56:24
I tend to just use is technically a virgin, which it's just sort of better support in windows and the advantages that you get DUI support,
56:27
which will only come with WSO when we go to 11 bands or when this month's windows Tenochtitlan,
56:38
which will give us WASC as well, which I don't have a recommendation.
56:48
I think people use virtual box of computer stuff, so I'm not entirely sure and.
56:55
Great, so that is how we how I set up Jinksy anyway, like I said, Haskell platform might work for you.
57:02
If so, great. If not, try this method and just really go to sleep and you can find the script here.
57:09
So as for the computer config, so I think that's what it made.
57:20
Right. So this would have made a joke about what let's see what's inside that, so that's got the.
57:29
So, yeah, I don't think you need a bit much insight here.
57:47
Honestly, this is going to be where it thinks, where the packages is, the package updates and stuff like that.
57:50
So I don't think you're going to really need to play around with the Cabal and the Cabal config file.
57:57
Uh, shouldn't be necessary for most people. Um, but it's in there.
58:04
So it's in your mind and it's in your home directory.
58:10
Talk about slash. Probably think. Interagency process show checks that you're in your hotel room for one day.
58:15
I'm not entirely sure. So I've never had a problem with that.
58:36
But obviously, different machines and different configurations will be different if you're in some terminal background
58:40
should work if your windows make sure you're in trouble and if it fails for whatever reason.
58:47
And no one knows how to fix it, then just try it as a platform instead and we'll see what happens if I try and do that.
58:55
So say yes, say what happens to the.
59:06
So I think it's probably going to be a conflict right now, but it still happens, so it should be as easy as that as well.
59:14
I don't know whether this little cabal alongside it or stack, so I'm not entirely sure.
59:24
I think it probably is. Yes, I was going to talk about. Oh, I'm happy.
59:31
That's nice. Yeah.
59:35
So this is a different alternative way. And that one is true. Just the eight point eight point three.
59:39
Yeah. So this is how you can use Haskell on your own machete. So if you're just going to use this stage extension and work on that machine,
59:45
you don't need to worry about doing this because those machines already have you installed on them.
59:51
So this is if you want to use it on your own machine, this is how you would go about doing it.
59:57
Uh, let's see if I actually had any effect. So in that one, I don't think Jinx yet is going to recognise.
1:00:03
I've got two of them now, so, yeah, that is not going to know that I just installed reported eight point four and that.
1:00:14
Yeah, nice.
1:00:26
And. So, yeah, ghc up is my preferred way, if there's not a bell directory and you go, yeah, I'm not sure where it's gone and.
1:00:33
But I guess if you run Kaboul for the first time, it'll probably generates a.
1:00:47
So let's say I'm happy to break this because it's a dummy place, so let's see, so I've now deleted,
1:00:53
I can now go run the ball and it still seems to do stuff and it's just generated to be a complete.
1:01:03
So if I check. It has not generated a conflict from this far will be generated, if you want to talk about it,
1:01:14
that will then generate you your conflict so automatically one update so you don't need to do this.
1:01:27
If you need, it will run kabal update if you just installed it has the platform one update
1:01:38
and that will fetch the latest package list and set up the conflict file.
1:01:46
Loucks. And yes, if you install it in the windows and the rectory, that might be a problem.
1:01:53
Yeah, because it will it will have to do Batarseh in that directory.
1:02:03
Perhaps it might work if it works, it works.
1:02:07
But I would make sure that you run the command in your actual living subdirectory so you can just you can just check.
1:02:14
It might work fine. It depends on where the Marshalsea is similar to.
1:02:22
Yeah. Just try try resetting the terminal and see if it works. But essentially they are just installed in this folder.
1:02:28
So that's all JDK has done. Is it sort of made these two folders and inside top GHC and.
1:02:37
Apparently for me is just these things here, I think is probably the subject here.
1:02:49
That's the one. Yes. There you go. Inside the jacket, dodges the folder that's worth basically storing the seeds.
1:02:55
And so there it is, eight point ten point seven. If I do the store, you see eight of it goes.
1:03:02
We'll see that a little bit of that. So that's where they just live. So as long as you can sort of get to that tree, it doesn't really matter.
1:03:16
So it's just a case of where the seeds put it. So I'm sure I'll say maybe you can check that out once it's finished installing it.
1:03:26
What for? Yes, if it failed to start running it in your home directory.
1:03:35
It's slightly different the way the will select us is this is WSO treats the widows
1:03:56
filesystem with with gloves on and the other way round when are treated as a network folder.
1:04:03
So they can't completely destroy it, which is why you should never try and find the actual location.
1:04:10
It's. And so, yeah, they might take each of a different day if you can install it, that, uh, they go to now.
1:04:17
Got two of them they live in and I will show my passion.
1:04:27
See. And just to show you where it put it in the past, so they go and install itself in Hanoi Jane, me.
1:04:32
And so that's where it sort of sourcing from.
1:04:44
So it might be different if you're a director and it might just be happy to point it out and put it in the right place and.
1:04:48
OK. I didn't know that was cheap to cook.
1:04:57
So there's two different approaches. Sedar Apte and so has the platform in your cell terminal or you can go the separate.
1:05:02
It's up to each other, works for you is going to be fine. I've just totally had no problems.
1:05:13
Jacir but it does depend on different machines and stuff like that.
1:05:20
So that's basically what I want to talk about today, is that any questions or anything they want me to go or.
1:05:25
I think that it's open for you to to ask.
1:05:34
What I was precluded from Panopto, um, I think a rather or Constantinos, you know,
1:05:43
where it's going to go, so you can, uh, you can check that it should be on Panopto.
1:05:54
Any other questions? I don't. Up the tunnel. So I'll be on Panopto and linked to Estancia.
1:06:02
It should be so yesterday's once you've been there, you can find it in the same place.
1:06:10
Yeah, thank you for thinking it in such a step in the telo with this gentleman.
1:06:17
I don't make sure you do so I shall say first before you try that or stop, because I don't know if you've already been to the actual script.
1:06:22
You're running that one first.
1:06:36
Actually installed also just for the fun, GHC is actually a high school programme,
1:06:44
so that's a real, real afterschool programme that you're running there.
1:06:51
So it's useful for things. Uh, Mr. President said that you need to restart your laptop even after you restart it.
1:06:56
Not sure that would be about an. So, yeah, I don't want to just about that.
1:07:05
You might want to just Google around for it just to check what's going on.
1:07:15
I guess that also makes all the distinction with Windows.
1:07:23
This is a little known fact. If you try and be stopped by doing shut down and then you turn it back on again, that is not an actual reboot.
1:07:28
You need to physically reboot it hard, which is often of restart or.
1:07:39
Yeah, that is the sort of things that you need to disable because what you just try is to not have to reboot everything every time.
1:07:47
So turning off the again does not necessarily restart your machine.
1:07:55
If you need help operation, where should we go? You can ask me during the lab sessions.
1:08:00
I think there's one tomorrow. And so I'll be in the lab sessions.
1:08:06
I'm actually going to be in the in the actual labs tomorrow in person.
1:08:10
So you can ask me then. If not.
1:08:17
Yeah, just ask me in any any of the the fellowship programme that I've had to lend and probably.
1:08:23
A.M., I am in the mall. But necessarily in person, I am in the middle of this.
1:08:33
Anything else? I will, yeah, like I said,
1:08:44
I like a way to post on the forums later they called these days they used to be something different and just become
1:08:54
violent so that people can just go find that in one place and also drop the the on the command style used today,
1:09:05
like the Haskell platform one. And they just get one of and stuff like that and.
1:09:15
So I would be that bit. OK, nothing else.
1:09:23
So now I will see you tomorrow for gift, which should hopefully which will involve installing anything.
1:09:29
So that's going to be probably a bit more a bit less problem for them.
1:09:39
But I'm also thinking we should move it to teams and just have one call because get this fairly operating system agnostic.
1:09:47
Yeah, it's fully operating system agnostic. I'm happy to do it on teams tomorrow because I'm just going to work on this machine.
1:09:57
OK, today I needed to work on two machines, so slightly different and that's what happens to teams tomorrow.
1:10:06
If that's going to work, which I think it probably will leave that up to you, right.
1:10:16
OK, so thank you, everyone. That is all and really sorry for the troubles with their meeting rooms.
1:10:25
We could possibly know how to live in advance. We didn't have enough people to test with.
1:10:41
So. Yeah, Asscher. OK, cool.
1:10:46
Well, I. I have room for just a couple of minutes just in case anyone else has anything to say.
1:10:53
Otherwise I'll say it like. They will go it.
1:11:00
The question is, what do you think, I'll watch it later.
1:11:24
Um. Yeah, and if you still don't find me in tomorrow.
1:11:30
And I'll see if I can help. I realise I've been using the chat while I could just use my micro study.
1:11:39
Thank you. Most of the stragglers, uh, that escaped the tunnel, but not as much, um.
1:11:46
That depends. Are you trying to connect by your command terminal or your cell terminal?
1:12:23
Yeah, so if you've got your set, the state keys in your can be set up to terminal, they're not going to be available for the.
1:12:36
They need to be in the actual windows. I think that's just running about it, in which case that should work and make sure you've done it in Windows,
1:12:47
you don't you don't need the key in windows. Yeah, not so.
1:12:58
I'm not sure why you have a problem with it if if you you're writing it about you that.
1:13:07
I can take a look at that in that as well. So help.
1:13:12
And, um. OK, so I guess the first question will be ending this call.
1:13:22
Yeah, that's fine. So it's my right, rabbi.
1:13:33
