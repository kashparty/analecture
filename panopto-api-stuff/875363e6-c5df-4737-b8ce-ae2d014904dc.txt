So let's see how path compression works.
0:01
So the idea is that we want to find the route, the leader for our Node X. Look at this Left-Hand diagram and but it might be further down the tree.
0:05
So if it's not at the root, is not actually parent of X, then we're going to actually flatten the tree.
0:17
So we're going to move X and all these other elements we find along the path the root up and say
0:25
that they are actually direct children of the route rather than being further down the tree.
0:32
So that has the effect of flattening the tree.
0:39
So we have extra work done in updating the parents for these nodes.
0:43
But we do keep the depth of the nodes lower so that the future finds are faster.
0:48
So next time we want to do a find the leader for any of these nodes,
0:53
then we can find it immediately rather than having to go or all the way down, all the way up the tree.
0:58
And the nice thing about this Barthe compression is it combines well with the weighted union on size as we saw it,
1:06
because the size is unchanged by path compression.
1:13
Supposing that we had done the more obvious thing of doing weighted union on the depths so that we put the
1:16
lower depth tree appended to the larger depth than the depth would be affected by the path compression.
1:21
So that would it wouldn't play so well with the two.
1:28
That kind of weighted unit would not go so well with path compression.
1:34
So here is the recursive procedure for come see find a, which is for finding the route and doing the path compression in the same at the same time.
1:39
So it's a recursive procedure. So first of all, to find the route for X, we look at its parent Y if.
1:52
Why is the same as X, then X is the route. And so we just return the root and do nothing else.
2:03
But otherwise we apply C find recursively on Y and find the root.
2:08
And if that route is not Y then that means that X was further down the tree and so will set parent of X to be root.
2:16
So that has the effect of flattening the tree and moving the X up. So it's a direct child of the root.
2:27
And obviously the C find. We'll do that recursively for all the other elements along the path to the root.
2:32
So it's the the blue line, the blue parts, the highlighted parts.
2:40
Here are the parts that do the do these lines here that do the path compression.
2:44
And if you admit that then you just get the normal find. So comparing our various algorithms,
2:51
Chris Gall's algorithm takes them log in Prem with priority queue is implemented with binary heaps m log in classic briem and squared.
2:59
So which is better? Well, it's just because the Cresco on the brim with priority cues are just the same.
3:09
Then it's the same argument as when we were comparing the two versions of Brimm.
3:16
So if we've got a lot of ARC's so dense graph, then M is order N squared.
3:20
And so Chris Gold is a bit slower than the classic primp.
3:28
If you take sparse graphs where aim is bounded by bigo of an log n say then kruskal or preme with priority cues give better results.
3:35
Because aim is lower and we get bigger. Avam log n is order big IV and log squared n.
3:47
So that will be to be preferred. A final remark.
3:55
We have talked about priority queue is being implemented with binary heaps and we will see how to do that later in the course.
4:02
But they can also be implemented with the more advanced concept of Phippen, Archie Heap's and with Ferencz Archie Heap's.
4:08
We can do a bit better on the operations. All the operations are constant time apart from Delete Men, which is bigo of log in.
4:15
And if we were to implement them with priority queues using Fabián Archie Heaps,
4:26
we can get the complexity down to Bigo of M Plus and Log N, which is an improvement.
4:31
It would seem looking at the big O notation,
4:38
but in practise it might not be as good as it seems because the memory usage and constant factors can be high with the Fibonacci.
