Title: Kotlin - s2e5 - Building Up Strings

Let's imagine we wanted to write some code to represent something like a radar screen.
0:06
So we have a number of different points on a plane and we have a circle where the radar can detect anything that's inside the circle,
0:11
but it can't detect anything that's outside. So let's see how we covered that up.
0:18
I've created a class here radar, and I've given it to properties already,
0:26
one of which is the list of points representing the points that you could see on the screen before hand, a circle which represents the field of view.
0:30
And here I've sent it the circle at three four and I've given it a radius of three.
0:39
So I've set these up as properties of radar, but you'll notice that they're not initialised using a constructor.
0:44
They just initialised directly in line. That's fine in this case because we don't need to vary the values.
0:50
So what I'd like to be able to do is to print the radar and have it showing the string representation only the points that are within the circle.
0:58
So if you want to print something in a meaningful way, then we overwrite the two string method, as we saw before.
1:06
So we'll start with override fun to string.
1:13
Which will return a string. And because I want to do something a little bit more complicated in determining what the string
1:20
representation should be going to do something slightly different this time I'm going to use an extra costs,
1:28
which is called a string builder.
1:34
So let's make an instance of string builder, which is in cross-linked text, and then we can use this to help us to build up the string.
1:38
Step by step, rather than having to complete the older ones.
1:48
So what I'd like to do is to iterate over the points that we have for each one, check whether or not it's inside the circle.
1:53
And if it is inside the circle, we'll add it to the string representation. And if it isn't, we'll just leave it out.
2:00
So let's, first of all, give some introductory text.
2:07
So I'm going to append that string to the string builder and be the first part that's built up.
2:14
And then we're going to iterate through each of the points and check whether or not we should include them.
2:20
And in this case, I'm going to do something slightly different from what we've done before and use a follow up to iterate through these objects.
2:26
So I'll say four point in points.
2:32
And this gives us the opportunity to operate on each point. So this is a much more imperative way of doing this,
2:39
rather than the higher order functions that we've done before in order to map or fold across Connexions.
2:45
So here we'll say if the field of view includes the point, then we'll just append that point.
2:51
To the string builder, and if it doesn't, then we won't.
3:05
Then once we've got to the end of all of the points, we can convert the string builder into one string that includes everything that we've collected.
3:09
So we do that by calling to string on the string builder.
3:16
So now if I write a main. And I print the radar.
3:23
We see that you get three points that are in view and those are the ones that are inside the circle.
3:38
Now that we've got that working, we might want to be able to move our radar so we can detect different points.
3:47
So for example, we might want to move to the left.
3:53
And to the left again, to the left again, and you'll see that with each of those steps, different points are within the circle.
3:56
So let's set up the code a little bit differently. Let's have a vowel for the radar.
4:05
And then after we printed it the first time, let's try to move left.
4:20
Congress is a method that doesn't exist. So what we'll do is implement that as a method of right up.
4:26
And all this is going to do is translate the field to be using the methods to be defined earlier on circles so we can say feel of view,
4:38
translate and move to the left will do minus one in the next direction and zero in a y direction.
4:45
Now, if I print this again, hopefully we'll see how things change.
4:54
And so we now see that one of the points is excluded. And if we do this a couple more times.
5:04
We'll see if we get a different set of points inside the circle each time that we move.
5:24
So what we've seen here is using a string builder in order to gradually build up a string and using a for
5:30
loop to iterate over a collection and then perform some operations on each element of that collection.
