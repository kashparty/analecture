Category: COMP40008 - Graphs and Algorithms (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Iain Phillips
Is that better on seeing the board? Oh, I think it's not, that's not no good at all.
0:43
Is it preset three? Yeah, that's what we made, I think is that three that's should be fine.
0:51
But no, let's move this out of the way.
1:00
Be more.
1:14
Yeah, not not.
1:26
Not. The consider.
1:31
From. We can move back into the zoo to that's.
1:47
Yes. Yeah. About.
2:03
All right, I think we might be ready, you can hear me, can't you?
2:21
Yeah. So we had a question in the chat about talking about topological sorting.
2:25
Let me just remind myself what it actually said, Marshall ordering all related.
2:35
So let's just have a look at this material on topological sorting.
2:42
So the idea here is that we've got a directed a cyclic graph such as the one in the diagram and what we want to do is to find.
2:49
A sorting of this as a total ordering, basically.
3:09
So we want but we want that to respect the order in which the tasks have to be done.
3:15
So we'd like to know that one is done before two.
3:23
But when it comes to seven or five, then we don't mind what order they are.
3:28
They are done in particular like that. OK.
3:35
So for instance, in this example diagram, a topological thought could be the one, then the six and then the three.
3:38
So I could do it by layers here. At least I in this diagram.
3:44
And then we can carry on.
3:50
That's got it. And then. Looks like just close that loop.
3:57
So, right. So. So then these directed Typekit graphs are quite related to partial ordering.
4:07
Now you will remember those people who did the discrete maths last term, you'll remember the definition of a partial order.
4:19
But if you didn't do that, if you're James C, then you may have come across it elsewhere.
4:25
But a partial order? Basically, we've got a sort of simple example of a partial ordering would be where we got sort of X, Y and Z here.
4:31
And maybe X is below Z and Y is below Z, but there is no ordering between the X and the Y.
4:41
So that's what we mean by a partial order in a total ordering that would have to be an ordering between the X and the Y as well.
4:51
OK. So that's why it's partial.
4:59
So in this case, we've got a greater set of well-defined, but we've got we don't have at least we have two minimal elements like that.
5:02
So what we the definition of a less than or equal i.e. weak partial ordering is that
5:10
the you have these three properties here reflexive transitive entry symmetric.
5:18
So all we have to do with the directory, the acyclic graph is to define if we've got our graph.
5:24
Here's a nice cyclic graph with one two three four five like that.
5:33
Then we can just say that if we have a path in the directed graph from one to four,
5:43
then we'll, as we do here, then we can say that one is less equal to four.
5:49
So one is actually less very equal to three,
5:53
four and five year two is less than or equal to three four one five three is less than or equal to four or five.
5:57
So just get rid of that. So that's what we've got in this directed a cyclic graph.
6:07
And then we could verify that this is indeed a partial ordering.
6:14
So if you like this, is this this particular cyclic graph is like a sort of hassid diagram shows the partial ordering,
6:19
but I mean, I suppose that we could have had an extra arc like that in the thing.
6:26
So that's not no longer a hazard diagram, because this path here can be deduced from this.
6:32
But this is a directed only slightly graph, and we can verify that this path satisfies the properties here.
6:38
So transitive and reflexive are just obvious from the definition of path, assuming that we allow a path to have zero length.
6:47
So you can have a path from yourself, which just means doing nothing.
6:55
OK, and then the symmetric part here that follows from the cyclic property here.
7:00
So and you symmetric because if we had let's say that we've got X and Y here,
7:06
and we used to suppose that X is less than or equal to Y and Y is less than or equal to X that would contradict, then what would that mean?
7:15
According to our definition of less equals, that would mean that there is a path from X to Y and there is not a path back for my two x, wouldn't it?
7:26
OK. So oh yes, but we're not.
7:37
Well, OK, yeah. So what that says is that we have got a cycle in this graph here.
7:46
And the only way, as you correctly point out, to get out of that will be to say,
7:51
Well, these paths must both be of length zero and therefore X equals y basically.
7:55
Otherwise we would have a cycle. So a zero length thing is not a cycle.
8:00
OK, so so that means that we therefore so that.
8:05
Implies X equals Y, so we have proved the anti symmetric property for this ordering on directed acyclic graphs.
8:13
OK, so that sort of gives us the.
8:24
Conversely, if you have a partial ordering,
8:28
then you can just create a direct to growth and just put arrows in arcs in directed arcs wherever X is less equal to Y.
8:32
And then again, it's easy to show that this is a cyclic just by sort of reversing this argument here, basically.
8:43
So that's the that's the sort of the correspondence that we get between the two.
8:52
Well, the so the topological sorting going back to the previous slide.
8:59
We've said that the topological consorting. Oh, I don't think I muted myself.
9:07
Okay, well, never mind. I hope so. And uh.
9:14
Right. So the topological sorting is defined here to be a total ordering here.
9:21
So in other words, we're finding a linear ordering,
9:27
which is compatible with the with the fact that we that was compatible with the directions given to us by the partial order.
9:30
So the top logical sorting here is really just finding a total ordering, which extends the partial ordering.
9:39
So in this case, we've got a partial ordering here.
9:46
And we could extend that to a total ordering in, obviously in two different ways, I could say that X is below Y is less dessert.
9:50
So this is a partial ordering. And this now is the total ordering.
10:01
Which I have arbitrarily said that I'll do X before Y if you like, but the top logical thought is not the top logical thought here,
10:09
but obviously so the top logical thought would be x y z or Y x z because you can't put Z into the into this.
10:17
You can't enumerate Z before you've done everything that comes before Z, namely the X in the line.
10:32
OK, that right? So later on, we'll see an algorithm sort of logical sort of based on depth search.
10:39
So we're sort of building up to that at the moment at the moment. This is just defining what the thing is.
10:50
It's fairly clear how you could find it. I mean, I think you can already see if we go to this diagram here.
10:56
You can see the method I've used here basically is to sort of keep on extracting minimal elements from it.
11:04
OK, assuming we know how to do that, then you can see the Div eight, one, six and three A. M. Also, let's put them in.
11:11
And then after I've done that too, in for the next minimal ones, etc. So just doing that obviously will give us topological thought.
11:18
So that makes it pretty clear that the thing exists, okay?
11:27
Because you've always got a minimal element that you can choose because of the cyclic property,
11:32
assuming that the I suppose if it was an infinite ordering, maybe you could have a problem with that, I suppose, because it might.
11:38
Let's say it was the the integers with negative numbers, then obviously that will be a problem for us to that.
11:46
Or something like that. But assuming I'm assuming here that it's a finite set that we're ordering, OK,
11:53
so that's that other questions from the audience here, things you'd like me to do overall, things from the tutorial sheet.
11:59
OK, I'll just have a look to see what's going on in the chat here. The linear liberalisation of thought, so I think I've covered that.
12:13
When you say total ordering, you mean defined for each pair. Yes.
12:28
So a total ordering says that if you take any two elements, well, okay, let me write down the property for being a total order.
12:32
Let's a. So a total order.
12:43
So this is a partial order. OK.
12:54
Plus, we have what's called tracheotomy.
12:58
Which says basically that exercise. Well, OK, try calling me would say X equals Y or X equals Y or why is less than X?
13:06
But maybe it would be just simpler just to say X equals lie or Y is less than or equal to x z.
13:20
Perhaps let's forget about.
13:26
That because they're all three cases, but that's if we're using less than equals as an ordering, then we've just got the two cases here.
13:30
So this is what fails between the X and the Y, you know, partial order and not a total order example.
13:39
But of course, if you take well known total orders such as the integers,
13:45
then it is true that for any two integers, one is less than or equal to the other like that?
13:49
Yup. Okay, so we might look to stop screen sharing in order to switch over.
14:01
You switch over to. Yeah, you.
14:15
Right. So are there any questions from here that you would like us to talk about?
14:35
We all managed to do them with no problem. Yes, question. Seven.
14:46
10. OK, so let's scroll on to the students and.
14:54
Well. So there is question 10.
15:05
Let's sell some space on the board.
15:11
Right, so we've got a simple graph and we want to show you that it's connected, so in general, the graph has connected components.
15:42
So a graph may not necessarily be connected, so if I draw a graph like let's we're dealing with.
15:58
Presumably we're dealing with undirected graphs here, so it's a one to three and maybe four.
16:07
But then we've also got five six and.
16:14
Seven like that, right? So here we've got two components in this graph, so the whole graph is.
16:22
What a green thing around it, just to illustrate that, but then pretty obviously,
16:33
we've got two components here, so we got sort of see one subgraph in the sea to subgraph like this.
16:39
This rather simple example. So what we've got to show is that that the can only be one connected component.
16:49
So everyone remembers what connected means. It means that for any two nodes, there's a path from one to the other.
17:03
So within these components, they are connected, but there is no path taking us from this component to this one.
17:08
If if we add in even a single arc going, let's say, from three to seven or something, then we would connect the whole graph.
17:16
Yeah, so but all right, so anyone got any suggestions as to what we could argue in this case?
17:24
Uh-Huh. Know. Right.
17:47
Mm hmm. Mm-Hmm. Yeah.
17:59
OK. I think you're on that side. I think that's the way to look at this,
18:04
basically is to think about supposing that we do have more than one component and then look at the cold analysis of the components.
18:08
Now you're talking about the number of arcs there, but I think we could also think about number of nodes in each component.
18:16
So what have we got here? We've got it. It's a simple graph.
18:25
So within a particular component, say we're x here and we're within component C, then what?
18:28
We're every every node of X has degree at least greater and over greater equal to and over two.
18:37
So what does that tell us about the number of nodes?
18:44
In this component. And over to.
18:48
Thank. Well, greater or equal to and over to.
18:56
Oh, well, but that's but then if we could have if it was equal to and over two, we could have.
19:03
We could have two components currently, so we need to be a bit tighter in all arguing.
19:10
We can say a bit more about this component here. Yes.
19:21
Yes, exactly. So basically, X has got at least an over two neighbours here.
19:39
Yeah.
19:43
So within this component, because we're dealing with a simple graph, we can actually say end of a two plus one because we can include the X as well.
19:44
You see so many opportunities for the neighbours of X. All these things that this is degree and over.
19:53
Well, in the worst case, this is degree and over two.
20:02
So we've got an over two neighbours plus x itself because we're dealing with a simple graph here.
20:05
So there are no loops. Otherwise that would slightly damage the argument.
20:10
OK. So, so that's well, now we're now we're doing quite well, b, because we know that each component has got at least one over two plus one.
20:17
So can we have more than one component?
20:27
No, we can't, because even two components would take us up to and plus two, which is too much because there are no.
20:30
Which is what we've told you so. So the argument here is is based on looking at the components and seeing what size they have.
20:41
So basically, if you're if each node is got especially high degree,
20:51
then the graph has to be connected and we've seen that over two will do it because if we went to end of it two minus one,
20:55
then we get another two for this. So we could indeed have two components, so we can't.
21:03
So that that's maybe some more elaborate argument could work for saying that we've got
21:10
so many nodes of this degree or something like that and then still things connected.
21:17
But anyway. Is that how it's done? So whenever you've got something to do with connected growth,
21:21
it may be profitable to think about the connected components and then build up from there because you can say something about each
21:28
component and then maybe say something about the whole graph because there's not much because they're not connected to each other,
21:35
then they are not interfering with each other in terms of what you can say about each component individually.
21:42
Right? Yep, that's that one. Let me just have a look in the chart.
21:49
Would a total ordering makes the graphs cyclic?
21:59
We're going back to the top logic ordering the question is would a total ordering make the graph cyclic?
22:05
Well, no, because a total ordering. If we go back to our sort of original mini example with our X, Y and Z, if we do a total ordering,
22:12
we say that the that would if we are, I suppose the question is if you if you added that to the graph as it were.
22:24
I see what you are getting. So.
22:37
That's what it would look like in that case, but that's not acyclic graph, I mean, it would be if it was undirected, but in this case, then so the.
22:44
So this would still be a cyclic basically. Yeah, I think that's true in general.
22:57
We'll see more of it, because if there was. So the question is, could we would be saying that there was already a you see if adding this.
23:05
So let's say that X and Y are not.
23:16
We had this warning for this to form a cycle that we'd already have to be a path for Y to X going by some other route.
23:20
But but if the walls then then we wouldn't be we wouldn't be adding in this thing here because
23:28
we're only going to get it on the basis that there is no room between them in either direction,
23:34
they say. So we could do that and we wouldn't create any side cause I'm pretty sure that seems to work.
23:38
Yeah. Good question. That's good.
23:45
Other things you would like to talk about. And the other one of the tutorial questions we'd like to talk about.
23:51
Sea have been. Question eight has being requested in the chat.
24:01
Let's have a look of it. OK, so that's sort of related to this one in a way.
24:10
So question eight, so we're talking about the plane, girl.
24:41
OK, so several souls example of a plane, a graph.
24:46
Then there we are. There's a plane, a graph one two three four, and we have Euler's formula that talks about the faces here.
24:56
So. So the notes here is four, and the ARC's is one two three four four one two three.
25:10
They I can get it right. I think it's six, isn't it? How many faces are there in this example?
25:22
Playing a girl?
25:28
For OK, so let's sort of number them in green, so there's one to three, and then you have to remember the outside as well to count that in.
25:31
So this is basically a tetrahedron.
25:43
I suppose, if that's been unpacked into the plane.
25:48
OK, so the face is just four. And then we we can check that the formula should work.
25:54
So a minus n two plus two is equal to f.
26:02
OK, great. So when I got it right. But now we want to generalise this to a graph that Scott C. Connected components, so we've got.
26:07
Let me sort of just draw this schematically see one see to how many components that we got.
26:21
Well, that wasn't a very good notation, was it? Let's let's change my notation because we will reuse capital.
26:31
We'll see this. So let's just use G for the subgraph. So G one g to.
26:37
Dr G. C, so this is just my rather rough and ready way of of the whole graph here is, well, maybe that wasn't a terribly helpful either.
26:44
Let's take that out. OK. So I'm just throwing them as sort of blobs here, these graphs, because I don't want to commit myself to what they look like,
26:59
apart from the fact that they are because the graph is plainer.
27:08
Each individual component must be plainer as well, because we can draw the whole graph on the plane.
27:16
So in particular, we can draw each of the individual graphs on the plane.
27:22
Obviously, that works in either direction here because they are disconnected from each other.
27:26
OK, so what we can do then is to apply Euler's formula to the individual components.
27:32
So what we have here is that if I is equal to a I minus and I plus two four equals one c OK,
27:39
so I have taken the hint in the question and I've written that down like that.
27:57
And what I want to do is to find. A formula for F in terms of A and C, so I want to say that F equals question mark something in terms of a.
28:03
And and see what that's what I'm looking for.
28:17
I've got to fill in the blanks here and so to see what that formula looks like.
28:23
So any suggestions? The kind of stuff all the sports.
28:29
It. So. Mm-Hmm.
28:40
Kind of the other side. Mm hmm.
28:48
Right? Yeah. Okay. So we could try sort of summing it up so we could add all of this up, couldn't we?
28:54
So we could say that some of the FISA I equals one to see is equal to the sum of the A's, minus the sum of the and I's.
29:02
Plus, what? So you see, because we've got three of these to see like that, OK?
29:15
Then you got that one as well. And one to get what, sorry.
29:26
So the final fish like the outside fish? Yes.
29:34
OK. Right. So what we've what you're getting at and I think you're both ahead of me on this is what has this got to do with a f and N here, basically?
29:38
So what's the relationship between the some of the flies and the the total number of faces?
29:53
So if you know, is that if it's like.
30:05
Yep. Up. You don't to want to one.
30:12
Yeah. So we've got the outside face here, outside face.
30:22
Lives outside here lives outside all of these components. And when you apply this formula to one, you are counting this outside face.
30:29
As part of that. OK, so how many times have we counted the outside face here?
30:40
Sometimes three times? Exactly. Yup. And what we want to do is not count it, see times we want, so we have to take off something.
30:48
So this would say that, yes. Plus, what was it?
30:56
B c minus one? Would be.
31:03
So this is basically a plus C minus C minus one here.
31:08
OK. And then but what about when we sum up the arcs in the notes?
31:13
Well, that's just that's just correct, isn't it for and and is equal to a minus and plus to C, OK?
31:18
And therefore, just by arithmetic, that's equal to a minus.
31:29
And. Plus, C, minus what a hang on C plus one.
31:33
Arithmetic. Yeah. OK. So. Let's check this.
31:43
How could we how could we check this? I mean, what would be a sort of sanity before I kind of ask question?
31:49
Yes. So is that house that like one component like nest to another component?
31:57
Like, for example, like if Ketu is a cycle and you too can be like.
32:07
Putin, the outside of Taiwan. Internet.
32:15
Not sure, I'm quite so you're saying that we've got so you want an example graph that.
32:22
You want to add G2 is the cycle you're saying. Yes.
32:29
Yeah, well, so too could be.
32:35
This may be. Yeah, and he was inside you, too, I mean, G-1 is inside.
32:39
Oh, I see what you're getting at. Yes. So we're saying that could be something like that, and that will be the one.
32:48
Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right.
32:55
Uh, yeah, I've thrown them so that they're not nested, and the question here is about the nesting.
33:00
But just to finish off this argument here, if if we put in there was just one component, then we would get back the original formula.
33:07
So that sort of shows that we're on the right track here.
33:17
I'm wondering what would be, let's try.
33:22
So here we have got two components. I agree. Put this pen down.
33:26
But it may be that my argument doesn't cover this case of nested components.
33:31
I mean, I think we can agree that this graph is plainer, but we've got g.
33:38
One is a triangle inside G two like that.
33:43
So what we've got here is that the number of faces looks like three.
33:50
And the number of components is two and the number of arcs is six, and the number of nodes is six.
33:58
So we do. So you plus one.
34:09
It does. We still get the right answer in this case, yes, in most places, it's like more.
34:14
Mm-Hmm. It's. I think it should be well defined, shouldn't it?
34:26
If we so your idea is that we move this one outside, yes.
34:35
And then we say that we haven't changed the number of faces. I mean, I think that would need proving.
34:40
But I mean, I think if that wasn't the case,
34:47
then there would be something that's not particularly well defined about the number of faces in that case, given that you know this,
34:49
we could all say that we know, we know that there are six nodes and they're connected as two triangles,
34:57
then some of them might draw the graph like this.
35:03
I probably wouldn't, but you know someone else would, and we should come up with the same answer on the number of faces.
35:05
It should be a well-defined concept. Yes. Hmm.
35:12
I think when we're counting faces,
35:23
we can't allow them to be sort of crossing each other because that would sort of confuse us in calculating the number of faces.
35:24
But we know it's plainer so that we know that we can draw the lines not overlapping,
35:31
but we probably should allow this as a valid presentation of a play in a graph.
35:37
I would tend to think, yes. So that's an interesting question.
35:44
Now it's so.
35:49
So then the thing is this argument, I think, as it stands, is a little bit not quite strong enough to cover this more general case of the nesting.
35:51
So I think it's a very good point that's been raised there.
35:59
So we might need to think a bit further about that. The suggestion?
36:05
Well, so one suggestion is we can move it outside and we we know that that doesn't change.
36:10
The number of face is that sort of would need to be proved.
36:15
Yes. But.
36:19
Yes. OK. I would think that's that sounds like a good basis for an argument.
36:30
So, so so what you're saying is we're going to add it's.
36:35
We're going to. We'd have to be careful to sort of cover every possibility here, but if we think about this one, then we're counting each.
36:40
This one has got two faces associated with it, hasn't it? And OK, I said it was the outside face.
36:50
And I agree that my argument is not general enough to cover this case.
36:57
But in this case, the outside face when we have this one is is a face that was already part of the existing growth, which is your argument.
37:01
I think we could make that work. Yeah, OK.
37:10
I'm just a little bit worried that if we've got so let's say we already got 20 in various forms of nesting, we ain't another one.
37:14
Wherever it's it could sort of we could add a third one that would be in between these two.
37:23
So we'd have to be sure that we're covering that possibility as well.
37:28
But I'm guessing it should still work because whatever the outside is of this thing, you're adding, this is your argument.
37:35
Whatever the outside is, it's already being counted as a face.
37:41
And so we need to take off one when when we add it.
37:45
Yeah, OK. So I think we have sort of, well, you have created an argument.
37:49
Well, so thanks to you for raising the issue of the of the of the the vested possibilities.
37:55
And I think what we have collectively come up with an argument that can cover that as well.
38:05
So I probably should change the answer that I've given for this one to to cover that more general
38:11
possibility because I was just sort of thinking of the components as separate like this,
38:18
which is probably sort of okay, but doesn't. I think there's more to the argument, really?
38:23
Yeah. Anyway, good. So the question is, can the face this formula be used to directed graphs to?
38:30
Well, I'm not aware of what it would mean for I mean, if it's a directed graph,
38:38
then in a sense we could still count the number of faces by just treating it as an undirected graph.
38:42
So that should work by just converting it to an underachieve graph.
38:49
So I'm guessing the answer is yes in that case.
38:53
So. I think what would go wrong with that, right?
39:02
We do have time still a little bit of time. Other things you'd like to chat about.
39:11
Yes. Right. OK. Good question. I think what we've seen here is that it's crucial to have an intuition as to what's going on.
39:27
No point in just sort of pin pushing or whatever. And I mean, maybe it will work in some cases or computer verification system can just chug away.
39:37
And perhaps you've got some arithmetical thing that you multiply in two matrices together.
39:46
Obviously, that will. That's fine. You just chug ahead and do it.
39:51
In this case, we have to have an intuition as to what's going on and what we've what we've decided to do here is to say,
39:55
basically, we're going to formulate this following. Your idea is to formulate this is an induction on the number of components, basically.
40:03
So so what?
40:13
We're going to start with one component and then, you know, the G one here basically and we've got all these formulas already given to us all.
40:14
It did that for us. And then we add in the second component.
40:23
And so the question is, so here is the one, if you like.
40:27
And then the second component comes along that we so we're going to add.
40:31
Well, no, maybe not. Well, OK. So.
40:37
All right, so I'm still not quite at the fool proof here, the second component comes along and it can't cross any of these.
40:42
So it must be entirely within one of these cases. So the second component could be, let's say, in here.
40:49
Right.
40:57
Previously, I was sort of arguing, which I agree is not general enough so that it could only be out there, but it could be in any of these places.
40:58
It can't be going across these spaces because we're assuming that we've got a we're assuming that we're drawing the thing without the ox crossing.
41:06
OK, but then now we've got to get the fully, fully general case.
41:15
We've got to say that. Suppose that. That and if.
41:20
Equals a minus and plus C plus one.
41:28
And then we're going to add another another. And we've got three components that.
41:33
And this so this is our induction hypothesis, and now we're going to add another component new component.
41:41
Which will be G C plus one. And then G C plus one.
41:51
Must be. Entirely.
42:01
Within. Face.
42:07
A face. Of. Existing guy.
42:15
So we go f of these spaces. It's got to be entirely within one of those spaces.
42:20
So that's the argument now. So and then we we say, therefore, that we're going to add in this many arcs.
42:27
I won't write it all down, but can you see how it's going? So we're going to add in the new number of arcs.
42:39
We've got the new number of nodes to add on to and what happens to the faces.
42:44
Well, the point is we add in the number of faces within the red zone,
42:49
but we take off one from, but we don't want to count the outside face of this new one.
42:53
So therefore we take off one for that basically. So and that then that should work.
43:00
I'll try and write that down for the for my improved answer on the basis of of this discussion, basically,
43:09
because my or my existing answer was along this, these lines that I agree that that's not quite general enough.
43:17
I think I I think I have a convenient way to think about this question.
43:25
So it's like you can defy a new world.
43:31
You can have a new definition of that that does not count the outside face and only counts in our face so we can cope f zero.
43:34
And when you like, add into component together, you can just like add the face together because, you know,
43:47
minus one rather than f basically and saying I won't count the outside world,
43:57
but with will still have to add in a single outside face at the end of the process.
44:01
But yes, that might be might be a good way to present it. So you like the subcomponents a in different in different place, the like.
44:08
The first, well, not change is how, like the adding together, it's not like you need to like minus one for the outside.
44:18
Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, there's different ways of writing it down. Yeah, I agree.
44:26
Yeah, that would work itself out.
44:30
But I'm not really.
44:36
That's not the threshold of the argument you were.
44:41
Well, OK, so if you if you drool this thing in the plane, then there is an outside place face.
44:50
But I could draw it a different way, and then this face will become the outside face by just changing the way.
45:00
If I just move, say, I want this to be the face, all I do is move this node into here.
45:07
And then lo and behold, then so.
45:14
So the outside face is not necessarily a well-defined concept here.
45:19
I mean, we think of this in 3D and it's got four phases, which are each triangles basically so.
45:24
So I think that's why all this formula is phrased the way it is.
45:33
So if you think about the cube graph, for instance, then the outside is like the back of the queue when you're looking at the cube graph.
45:37
But then we could just sort of rotate that cube as it were and just change and then that
45:47
that back phase would come to the front and something else would be the the back face.
45:52
So you've got you know what I mean by that. Here, here is all.
45:58
He [INAUDIBLE] off. And then this big square here, if you like, represents the the the back of the queue, what we call it.
46:06
We talk about that as being the outside face when we're counting the number of places,
46:16
but it's really the the back of that thing seen in and a sort of expanded 3-D version.
46:19
Yes. You problems or visual for.
46:25
We're else. Well, I think if you took any, any sort of poly Hedren, no matter how irregular,
46:36
then you could just stretch it out and then it would it would be plainer.
46:45
How do you think about it? So just like we've done with the cube here,
46:51
basically we've just sort of scratched the back of the cube to fit it in in the plane
46:55
so we could do the same with an eye Hedren or something like that's got to be useless,
47:00
hasn't it? I think so. We've just sort of expand the thing and I can see that the next people are waiting, so I think we'll have to do this to them.
47:06
But can you see what I'm if we just sort of imagine it is rubber, you know, imagine neuropathologist or something,
47:15
and everything is rubber, so you can just stretch it out, then you can, then you can put that in the plane.
47:21
So anything that really is 3D can be converted into this form.
47:27
We talk about it as plane of grass because we're doing graph theory.
47:33
But I mean, if you will, it's all the more geometrical or whatever, then you can see it differently.
47:36
OK, it's time to stop and let the next lecture start.
47:41
So thanks very much. Interesting questions. Stop recording.
47:47
It's.
