So now I want to talk about Isomorphic, some between Groff's.
0:01
What does it mean for one Grauwe to be the same as another? So let's consider the two example graphs on the left of this slide.
0:06
The top the red graph has got four nodes. This is the bottom graph.
0:16
I've tried to make them look as different as possible. So I've label the nose one, two, three, four on the top on and ABC d at the bottom one.
0:20
And I've made them in different shapes,
0:29
but they actually old and in a sense they do have the same shape because the nodes are connected in the same way.
0:31
We could analyse a bit further looking at the degrees of the nodes. And you can see that we've got three no's of degree, four in the top graph.
0:41
And and in the bottom graph. And the other node has degree two.
0:50
We can also see that we've got two parallel pairs of parallel arcs in each graph.
0:54
And they have they sort of meet in a common node, either one or B.
0:59
And so we would like to explain how these two graphs correspond.
1:06
And indeed, we'd like to build up a correspondence between the nodes in the top graph and the bottom graph, as well as the arcs.
1:12
So which nodes should correspond? Well, an easy place to start would be to say, well, if they are to be the same graph,
1:20
then we should map the nodes at the same degree to the same degree.
1:30
So we would have to map map the three to the D.
1:33
So we would have to do that. And then we could also see that B and one are the only nodes that have got two pairs of parallel arcs.
1:38
So they should map to each other. And then we've got the A4 could either go to the EH or to see.
1:52
And because there's a symmetry, there's a vertical symmetry in both of these graphs.
2:02
If you think about it, we can reflect them through the vertical axis. So that's that tells us what we might be looking for in an isomorphic.
2:06
I mean, otherwise a mapping from the nodes of one graph to the other.
2:17
So that's what I said on this second slide here, that three must correspond to D.
2:22
One must correspond to B.
2:28
One is the only node that's not adjacent to three.
2:33
So that's another way of putting it. I said it differently. I said it was to do with having the two pairs of parallel arcs.
2:38
So we could go either way. And so now we've got our two mappings, which are two goes to a foregoes.
2:44
Three or two goes to see foregoes two, eh?
2:53
So let's fix on. Let's saying that two goes to A and four foregoes to C.
2:57
So now we have a bijection between the nodes. But we want more than a bijection, we want this bijection to keep the connectivity the same.
3:04
The Connexions have to be the same. And we are sort of trying to ensure that while we were developing this bijection,
3:16
now it's fairly obvious that they do correspond because I think you can just mentally transform the bottom graph,
3:21
just move the B up and then you can sort of see in your mind that they are actually the same.
3:27
So I think for a small graph like that, that might be fair enough.
3:34
But if we wanted to actually cheque that rigorously that we really have gotten isomorphic from here, then we can look at the adjacency matrices.
3:38
So let's do that. So in the standard order, the adjacency matrices will be as follows.
3:45
And, well, they look really quite different. So there's no it's not obvious that this nice isomorphic some from looking at.
3:54
But what we need to do is we can reorder the right matrix to correspond to our mapping.
4:01
And we mapped one, two, three, four to be ADC. So let's write rewrite this right and matrix in the B ADC order both for the columns and the rows.
4:08
And lo and behold, we get exactly the same matrix as we did for the one, two, three, four graph.
4:20
So that tells us that we have indeed got an isomorphic them between the two graphs.
4:27
So now let's actually define isomorphic then rigorously.
4:36
Up till now, I've just been relying on some intuition about isomorphic.
4:41
So nice, Morpheus, and let's define it to be a mapping both on the nodes and on the arcs.
4:46
So and I guess Warsan Morsan, from G to G prime,
4:53
where these are two to digraphs is a bijection F from the nodes of the one to their nodes at the other.
4:55
Together with a bijection G from the arcs of onto the arcs that the other.
5:03
And it has to have the preserve the connexion. So that's the property we need.
5:08
Is that if a is an arc of the first graph G. And it has end points and want an end to it.
5:13
Then when we map across the endpoints of G of a in graph G prime we'll be F of N one and F of N two.
5:20
So in other words, the mappings on the nose and the arcs actually go nicely together.
5:30
And that's what I've drawn in this diagram.
5:38
And in that case, we'll say if there is an isomorphic, some from tree to tree, Prime will say that tree is isomorphic to G prime.
5:40
And in terms of the adjacency matrix is matrices, it amounts to seeing that they are the same,
5:48
except that the rows and the columns may have been reordered, as we saw in our example.
5:56
Well, how could we test whether to Graff's or Isomorphic, the simplest thing to do would be to start with the obvious cheques,
6:04
such as looking at the number of nodes, the number of arcs.
6:13
Now we know that we need a bijection on the node, so therefore there has to be the same number of node.
6:16
We know we need a bijection on the. So they have to have the same number.
6:21
So if those were different, then obviously the graph's can't be isomorphic.
6:26
Beyond that, we could look for loops, maybe parallel arcs as well.
6:31
And because any loop has to be mapped to a loop. And we can look at the degrees of the note.
6:36
And again, the degrees have to be the same in the two graphs.
6:43
So if any of these turned up a difference, we have got an easy cheque that that tells us that the graphs can't be isomorphic.
6:48
But if they are the same on these, then we might begin to suspect that there is an isomorphic them.
6:55
And then we will be looking to try and find a bijection. Typically we do this on the node rather than the arcs.
7:02
It's easier to think about the bijection on the nodes and then the well,
7:08
the bijection on the arcs will be to some extent implicit as it was in our example.
7:13
They note, if we go back to our example, the bijection on the arcs here is not totally defined here because we've got parallel arcs.
7:20
So actually we've got two different arcs here. And so there are there is potentially they could map to either of either of these parallel arcs here.
7:31
So that gives us more variability in the arc mapping.
7:43
If if the graph so simple, then then matters are easier and basically the mapping on the arcs is fixed.
7:47
Okay, so. In general, this question of whether to graft their isomorphic has a quite a high complexity.
7:58
What we need. We've seen what we need to do. In a sense, it's very easy.
8:07
We just need to see whether the adjacency matrices are rearrangements of each other.
8:12
Now, that's something that we could easily programme a computer to do for us.
8:18
It would just show the way. Look at all the rearrangements and see whether are one of them is identical.
8:21
And then we do get our isomorphic. Some of the bad news is that there are n factorial rearrangements if there are any nodes.
8:26
And in fact, all is worse than exponential, i.e. two to the N.
8:35
So that's going to take us a very long time. So that is not a attractable algorithm for testing whether two graphs or isomorphic.
8:39
And indeed, it's not known whether this problem can be solved in polynomial time.
8:48
I should remark that quite recently.
8:55
Laszlo Pabbi has shown that graph isomorphic can be solved in what's called quasar polynomial time, which is exponential in poly logarithmic.
8:57
In other words, locate the power K of N for some K.
9:10
So that's better than exponential. So it's better than R n factorial naive method.
9:16
But it is still worse than polynomial time.
9:22
Well, a special case of ice and Morpheus is automatic for some, and that elsmore for some on a graph is an isomorphic, some from G to itself.
9:28
So if you like, you can think about creating two copies of G.
9:38
And talking about isomorphic essence between G and the copy of G, if you like.
9:42
They are, of course, the same graph. So let's look at an example.
9:48
Here's a square graph. One, two, three, four are the nodes. Well, there's various auto morph isms.
9:53
We could have. So we could do a 90 degree clockwise rotation. So one maps to two.
9:59
Two to three. Three to four. Four to one. That's an auto morph ism.
10:04
And another one would be where we flip over the one and the three, but leave the two in the four unchanged.
10:10
I flip across the diagonal. In other words, in it, as you can see, that the auto foursomes here are to some extent geometric all things.
10:19
In this particular graph, like we can map symmetric, we can flip across a diagonal using or flip across the vertical line using the.
10:28
There's the symmetry here and there's rotational symmetry as well.
10:41
So we can do a rotation by various amounts. But if we wanted to count how many or two more films were, how might we do that?
10:46
Well, we could say, well, let's try different rotations and then look at the flipping across the diagonal,
10:55
flipping across the horizontal, the vertical, etc. But then we'd have to combine them as well.
11:02
So we'd have to say, what about if you did a rotation followed by flipping across the diagonal,
11:09
followed by another rotation back the way, it all gets a bit complicated.
11:14
So what I recommend here, rather than trying to count them like that,
11:20
which is a slightly more systematic way of doing it, is to do it more combinatorial.
11:24
So let's say a method is, as applied to this example, is to just go through the nodes.
11:32
In turn, it doesn't matter which order you take the nodes in. You can choose one to suit yourself.
11:36
But let's start with one. Well, how many places could one map two?
11:42
Well, we know that it can go to any of these four. So there's four different places it can go to.
11:46
So then we effect's one, let's say one where it used to be easy.
11:53
And then look at two.
11:57
Now, you might think that you can go to three places because one is obviously fixed now, but two has got to stay adjacent to one.
11:58
So two is only got two places to go to, namely two and four.
12:06
So two has got two places. Let's fix two now then three has got.
12:11
Well that three has got to go to either three or four, but three can't go to four because three has to stay adjacent to two.
12:19
One and two are fixed. So three is fixed as well. And then four is only got is one place to go to.
12:27
So then we just multiply this together. The four times the two times the one time is the one and we get eight.
12:34
Notice that does include the identity mapping. In other words, where we leave one, two, three and four where they are originally.
12:41
For a second example, slightly different graph with a dying and awe.
12:51
And as you might expect, having that diagonally in reduces the amount of symmetry in the graph.
12:57
And so we got fewer or more physicians. But let's count them by our using our method.
13:03
So one as our it now. And he got two places to go to because it has to stay with a node of degree.
13:08
Three. OK, let's fix one then.
13:13
Now then two has got two places to go to because it's got to be Drayson to one.
13:18
So two or four. So two has got two places to go and then three and four are fixed.
13:23
Exactly as in the previous slide. So we get two times two times one times one, which is four, including the identity.
13:29
