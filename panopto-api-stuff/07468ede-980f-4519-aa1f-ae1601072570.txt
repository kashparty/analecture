So a path in a graph is just the obvious thing. It is a sequence of arcs that takes us from a start.
0:02
No. To a finish node within the graph. And usually we describe paths by the nodes pass through rather than actually labelling the arcs.
0:08
So in our example graph, we have a path. One, two, three, four of LEM three.
0:18
And we have paths to five to three.
0:23
Then round the loop to three and then four. For instance, let's say that a path is simple if it has no repeated node.
0:27
So our first path here is obviously simple. But the second one has repeated nodes.
0:35
And so it is not simple. And we can now define what it means for a graph to be connected.
0:41
We already informally talked about that. But now we can define a graph to be connected if for any pair of nodes.
0:48
There is a path. Joining those two nodes. So pretty clearly this graph in the example here is connected graph.
0:54
On the other hand, this graph is not connected. In fact, it has two components.
1:04
Each of those are connected to a BFG is obviously a connected subgroup of.
1:09
And so you CDE but there is no way to get across from the one component to the other.
1:14
We can make this idea of connected components more precise using this equivalence relation.
1:22
Let's say that X is related to Y if and only if there is a path from X to Y in the graph.
1:30
So that forms a binary relation on the nodes of G.
1:36
And we can cheque that this is an equivalence relation. And this is something that was covered in the first term discrete mathematics course.
1:40
But I realised that Jamesy people may not have seen these definitions,
1:50
but let's just cheque that this relation does have these three properties reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
1:56
So let's. Draw a general idea of what a graph looks like.
2:03
So this is my rather schematic notion of what a graph looks like.
2:11
I'm just going to draw it as a general sort of oval here.
2:15
And because I don't want to be too specific about what the graph looks like. So we want to cheque, first of all, that it's reflexive.
2:20
So that means that for any node X, there is a path from X to itself.
2:27
Well, if we just allow an empty path, then we can indeed see that X is related to X.
2:33
So let's allow that path can be a blank zero so we don't have any arcs in them.
2:42
Now we need to cheque that if there is a path from X to Y. This is a symmetric property.
2:48
So here is my general path. Destroy it as a wavy line to be not too specific.
2:53
So if X is related to Y.
2:58
They were pretty clearly Y is related to X. Why is that?
3:02
Because we can just reverse our steps on this path, because the graph is undirected.
3:07
Finally, let's suppose that X is related to why and Y is related to Z.
3:13
A third note here. So let's draw another wavy line for that part of the path.
3:20
Then so if we have X is related to why and why is it said, then what we want is that X is related to Z.
3:26
This is the transitive property. And that is obviously true because all we have to do is concatenate the two paths.
3:37
And we have a path from X to Z. So that means we have checked all three properties.
3:44
We can then use our general theory about equivalence relations to say that we the equivalence classes we can form.
3:50
We can partition this graph into equivalent classes.
3:59
So if I draw a new diagram here, here is the graph again.
4:03
And then we can partition this into equivalence classes.
4:09
So here is a partition of the nodes of G like that, maybe into, in this case, four components.
4:12
One, two, three, four. And each of these components would be the equivalence class.
4:22
From some node, any representative node within this class.
4:29
So here is X one. Let's say here is X two.
4:33
Areas X three and here is X for.
4:39
And the equivalence class of node, which is often written like that, is defined to be the set of Y, such that Y is related to X.
4:45
So this, as I say, the general theory means that we have partition the graph into these equivalence classes,
5:01
and pretty obviously each of those equivalence classes is the connected component of the graph.
5:09
Now, a special case of a path is a cycle sometimes called the circuit,
5:24
that is a path that finishes where it starts, and we'll say that it has to have at least one arc.
5:30
And we'll have to we'll say that it doesn't use the same arc twice because we don't want erm sort of meaningless cycles.
5:36
So in the example graph we've got one, two, three, four.
5:45
And back to one snow repeated arc. And we get back to where we started.
5:50
So that is a cycle. Three. Three. Just going round the loop.
5:56
We'll count that as a cycle. But two. Five, two.
6:00
Well, okay. We got back to where we started, but we use the same arc twice.
6:03
So that shouldn't count as a cycle. So we don't allow that as a cycle.
6:07
So, of course, this graph does have at least two cycles in it.
6:14
But if a graph has no cycles in it, then we can call it a cyclic.
