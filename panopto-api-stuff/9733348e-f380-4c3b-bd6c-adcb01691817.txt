Title: Sequences I (Live Recording 11 and 13/10/2021)
Category: COMP40016 - Calculus (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Paul Bilokon
Date: 24/10/2021
We start by looking at sequences. And this is a very important election because it is in this lecture that to introduce the idea of limit.
0:17
OK, so here is our rule.
0:31
The only stupid question is, well, not asked me if I if for some reason I miss your question on Tienes repeated so I can see,
0:36
because some of the questions are moving quite quickly. So I'm trying to answer them as I go along.
0:50
But it's a good idea to remind me if I don't answer your question, it's not because I don't want to.
0:57
It's because I didn't see it. The only stupid question.
1:03
OK. Let's go former.
1:08
And the book is Advanced Calculus, but that's not the main book for the course,
1:14
the main book is being more mathematical analysis, a straight, straightforward approach.
1:20
That's the main book for the course. That's the main book by Benmore Mathematical Analysis, A straightforward approach.
1:28
OK, the Butler revelation over sex and B is a subset of a Cartesian product eight times B,
1:38
that is, it is a set of ordered pairs A B consisting of elements in A and B in B.
1:46
It's a common concept of relations,
1:56
an element is related to be if and only if the pair a B exists belongs to the sex represented by this binary relation,
1:59
by the relation is the most a special case of an enemy relation over sex, a one to an which is a subset of a one types of times.
2:09
And questions of this light. Does it is it does it make sense what the binary relations.
2:21
I expect you guys to have questions and I'm sorry about what is heard to and product.
2:28
OK, let's just go into this in a little bit more detail.
2:36
So I have they said, hey, could you guys see my screen?
2:50
As I'm typing, yeah, I have a set, which is cat and dog.
2:58
Right, the elements of this set up, Captain Doug, I have another set of elements are.
3:06
Seven. And so what's the Cartesian product of these sets?
3:17
What's a Cartesian product of this set of these sets?
3:32
So, OK, times be it's good to be also set.
3:36
It's also going to be a set whose elements are going to be pairs of elements that are going to be right.
3:43
You can guess the next one. Zero zero for the next one.
3:59
S Fred. Dog threat, exactly. Is it better there?
4:11
Yes, thank you. At Dog seven.
4:22
OK, zero. And that is the conclusion product.
4:31
And it's not the same as times eight, because three times they will have different elements, there will be bread cuts.
4:43
So on. So it's a pair, it's a position of very important.
4:57
Like, which is the first no insects, the order doesn't matter.
5:05
I just use like. It's similar to the Matrix issue.
5:12
Exactly. So the order doesn't matter.
5:17
But the other part is important that it's very important to understand the implications of the loss of the 50 people as well,
5:23
because so I didn't catch that.
5:35
I'll cover the chapter. OK, let me have a look at the chart.
5:41
OK, so the binary relation. Is a subset of a Cartesian product, like a binary relation is a subset of a Cartesian product.
5:51
So let us change and be let us come up with the input may have to be multiplicative conformable so they're not matrices,
6:07
they are sets the input A and B that go into this Cartesian products are not matrices.
6:19
They are sets. Right. We are not yet working with matrices.
6:26
We're working purely with sets. Is the use of curly brackets versus parentheses significant?
6:30
Yes, when I use parentheses, I usually imply that the order matters.
6:39
When I use curly brackets, I imply that the order does not matter.
6:44
Where can we find the slides, I'm going to put the slides and materials after I have told them right.
6:50
So I don't tend to put the slides before I have taught them the materials, what I have taught them, I put them in materials that will be accessible.
6:56
But what is the difference between a matrix, a set and a list?
7:03
A set? OK, so let's get this straight.
7:10
So if a set is a collection of objects, so let me just change the font here to something larger.
7:14
So a set is just a collection of objects.
7:25
The order. It's quite useful to write notes on the actual slides themselves as we go along.
7:46
OK, you've convinced me. Let me give you the slides. Let me give you the slides.
8:01
Let me give you the slides. But look ahead to much, if I ask a question, think about the question.
8:22
Don't look at the answer in the slides. So certainly the slides, so with sets poll thirty seven minus one is equal to minus one.
8:35
Thirty seven or so, Paul thirty seven.
9:00
It's also equal to minus one, minus one minus one thirty seven for so long as the elements are the same.
9:04
As long as the elements all try to publish them, okay. OK, as long as the elements are the same, this thing is the same.
9:25
So this is a set. Now for a list.
9:35
The order, Mrs. OK, the order matters, so this is not the same as.
9:44
Not a pass thirty seven, cold minus one.
10:06
You cannot in Texas. That's right. You cannot, Index says.
10:13
For matrices, we don't even go into matrices, so I'm not even going to show you what The Matrix is at this point in time.
10:22
Right, you can index lists, so for example, that book, but you cannot index says that's correct.
10:29
This is just a collection of elements and an element is in the set, well, not in the set and the repetitions don't matter, right?
10:41
There is no notion of how many times an element is set. Right.
10:51
You can't have duplicate things in the list. Yes, you can have a list, which is Paul.
10:57
Thirty seven. Thirty seven minus one. So that's not the same as Paul.
11:02
Thirty seven. Minus one. Yes.
11:09
Actually equal four sets, matter how many times you have written it, it's still the same as this.
11:24
So there is no notion how many times something is in the set.
11:32
The question is, is it or is it that? OK, does that answer your question?
11:36
We haven't yet studied. Well, we'll audit says.
11:48
Basically, what I'm saying, there is no way of indexing sets, OK, three relations, but let us consider two sets.
11:52
One, two, one, two, three, who can tell me what the confusion, according to the census?
12:04
The third element. Well, one on one, I mean, there is no notion of the first element, what's what what one is that one?
12:14
Two is the two and three is the two.
12:26
What is the two? Two ways and two threes.
12:33
OK, now let us talk about the binary relation.
12:41
Let's say the bloody relation is equals.
12:50
So it's going to be a subset of this set.
12:57
Who can tell me which elements are going to be in the equal binary relation?
13:03
Well, two to one, one, two, two.
13:09
That's it. What about, I say, less than.
13:15
Which elements are going to do that? One, two, one, two, three, one, three, three.
13:24
OK, so your relation is a subset of a Cartesian product.
13:37
Does this make sense?
13:44
It says something like, we apply a condition to the character of the product and we filter out some of them and remember something else.
13:47
I mean, it can be arbitrary, right? So this is all set by the. So I delete this and I delete this.
14:01
OK, so that's some sort of the Bible regulation.
14:16
OK, I don't even know what it means.
14:23
OK, so we don't necessarily need really a condition about which one to filter out, but we can't just have random more.
14:30
We can filter it out randomly whichever way we want. OK, does that make sense?
14:42
So all of the ones listed below that equals less than strange or binary relations, they are all binary relations.
14:51
They're all subsets of the Cartesian product. OK. Thank you.
15:00
Let's go back to it's Kurdish is cutting product itself a battery and yes.
15:06
OK, so I hope this answers all your questions. Let's go back to the slides.
15:27
OK. So an example of a binding relation is the divides relation over the set of prime numbers and the set of integers in which each prime.
15:41
So I say price, but it should be it should be prime.
15:55
Thinking too much about money. Each crime is related to each integer Z, that is a multiple of P, but not to an integer, that is not a multiple.
16:01
So in this relation, for instance, the prime number two is related to numbers such as minus four zero six and 10,
16:14
but not to one and nine, just as the prime number three is related to zero six and nine, but not to four or 13.
16:20
So we can put this in the language of set.
16:29
So we have in this one in relation to minus four to zero to six to ten, but we don't have two, one and two nine, for example.
16:31
So likewise, we have to be zero three six and three nine, but we don't have three, four, three, 13 in this one in relation.
16:42
So here are some examples of binary relations that are used throughout mathematics.
16:50
Whether they're very important in mathematics is greater than is equal to.
16:54
Divides is these old binary elections used in arithmetic is congruent to a geometry is adjacent to in graph theory,
17:01
is orthogonal to in linear algebra. Right.
17:13
So violations are very common throughout throughout mathematics.
17:16
Key. Now we look at a special kind of a binary relation called the function function from a
17:25
set A to set B is a mathematical object that associates to every element A in a big A,
17:36
a unique element F of A in capital B, and we do note this like so.
17:43
So, for example, we may have a function that adds one, but it's also about the relation.
17:50
However, it's a special case of a binary relation because a function associated exactly one element to a particular element of a.
17:56
Exactly. One, not two. Not three. Just one. OK, so it's a special case.
18:07
The function is a special case of a binary relation.
18:12
So function is buy the relationship to functions are special bilateral relations, not all bilateral relations are functions.
18:20
So, for example, divides associates to two, both four and six.
18:27
And it's therefore not a function because associate each element of the set only to excel, and therefore it is a function called an identity function.
18:32
Any questions on this? Any questions?
18:43
Debate. OK. Let's look at just the more set.
19:02
Yes, many to one count as a function, so X, X, Matsue, X squared is a function.
19:24
Now, let's look at, for example, debates, let's look at a.
19:34
OK, look at the binary relation divides. We have in this binary relationship.
19:56
Is it possible if you can zoom in a bit cranky?
20:10
What do we have in this body relation dust to divide to.
20:24
Yes. As to divide three, No.
20:30
Thus, to divide four. Yes. A study by five, those six and eight.
20:36
To some extent, to it, what about three, the three devoted to.
20:47
No, so sorry, sorry, sorry, six and three not.
20:52
OK, that's divines. Is it clear enough?
21:00
OK, that's exactly as Daniel has posted. Does every element in a need to be up to something so not necessarily.
21:14
Not necessarily to be a part, OK, no. Yes, every element, every element needs to be mapped to something.
21:24
So every element needs to be up to something. Otherwise we'll have a partial function, which we're not considering.
21:33
Right. Every element needs to be mapped to something.
21:41
So just to look at your question, every element, a so every element needs to be mapped to something.
21:53
OK, every element needs to be mapped to something. So do we talk about the money and in his case, we can talk about the mountain range?
22:04
I'm not going to introduce them just yet. So but DeMain and Racha useful Babson's.
22:14
OK. All right.
22:23
So just to look at the way the function that you said is many to one, yes, many to one is fine because minus two is up to the same thing as two.
22:35
But we cannot have one too many. When you say every element, is that for.
22:47
Your relations. OK, no binary relations can be many to many can be everything, right?
23:03
It's just a subset of the Cartesian product. So Biodome relations are much less restricted than functions.
23:11
Can you explain the fourth point? One, two, three, four.
23:17
OK, so if we have a function that associates to three, a pair minus three and three, that's not going to be a function.
23:21
Right, if we associate the three, two things, one is three and three, that's not going to be a function.
23:32
However, we can think of this as a function that takes values, assets, in this case to three.
23:38
We associate a unique set so that it is a function.
23:49
So it's a subtlety and we don't worry about it too much.
23:52
Don't worry about it too much, not super important, but if we consider that the type of dysfunction is not end to end,
23:56
let's end to the power set up and the power centres are set up, all subsets of it, then that becomes a function.
24:04
But I'll worry about too much, don't want to confuse, OK?
24:13
All right, so these are subtleties, so you have already told me that this group is called a parabola,
24:19
so it functions are a core concept in mathematics and computer science.
24:25
Very, very, very important. Now, when you programme right, when you programme, we can also define functions.
24:30
OK, let us. Let me introduce this notion of a Powerset.
24:40
So. OK, let me introduce this notion of a Powerset.
24:49
So let's say we have a set two, three. What's the power set off of?
25:03
Who can tell? Who can tell me what that is?
25:12
It is a set of all subsets. And to be the empty set, so, you know, just like this, it's the set to the set three and the set two three.
25:24
So all possible subsets of this set, it's the set of all subsets.
25:40
That's what the power centres. Does that make sense?
25:45
Can you answer an earlier question about our. I can't see this question about stereotypes.
25:51
Oh, what is the difference between the two arrows, so let me go back to the slides.
26:02
Let me go back to the slide. So what's the difference between the two arrows?
26:15
So I use the arrow without the horizontal thingy when I talk about the type of a function.
26:20
So I'm saying it takes a natural number and it maps it to a natural number.
26:28
But I use an arrow with the thing when I when I define a function, when I say that it maps X to X plus one.
26:35
So these are two different arrows. Yeah, not super important, but it's good, to be precise, with the powers that is, it always took to the set.
26:42
Could it be like three just notation? It's always two to the set.
26:55
It's just how it's written. It's just notation is just syntactic sugar.
26:59
OK, thank you. It's not actually taking two to the power.
27:04
I mean, it's. Do you know why people use this notation? No.
27:08
OK, let me explain that. Let me explain why people use this funky notation as as Andy has said, it's about the size of this set.
27:16
Right. So if we look at it, we'll look at this.
27:29
If we look at this. How many elements of the Powerset?
27:35
True and false, and that is true to the power of the number of elements in the original set,
27:44
so it's due to the power of two because there are two elements here. So it's due to the drought.
27:52
That's why we use this due to the power rotation, because it gives us the number of elements.
27:59
If the set is finite, it doesn't have to be fine. Right?
28:06
It doesn't at all have to be it. Right.
28:10
That's why we use this notation. Slide's.
28:17
Going back to the slides. It's so it's this kind of final relation controls function, but a natural no to the power of sight, to the part of it.
28:25
Well, I'm not sure that's not the question.
28:43
Can you repeat? So it's a function because so I'm talking about.
28:51
So it was so still functioning, right?
29:02
A power is not a function. Well, so I mean, like from all sides to its power, it's still only to function.
29:09
Yes, it is a. Taking values, assets and function can map a no to asset it's allowed.
29:23
Yeah, if you think of it as end to end, it's not a function because it's not a function, because it's mapping to two different things.
29:35
But if you think of it as end to the power set, it is a function.
29:44
Right. So it depends on how you need the type of a function is important.
29:49
Does that kind of answer your question? But why map X to minus X and politics has turned from natural no to the powers that matter?
29:54
No. Because the value that you are assigning to it is a set, it's a set containing two elements.
30:07
So we're making X to a set containing two elements.
30:16
So that is allowed. That's still a function, but it's a function.
30:23
Does that answer your question? Yes, but just from the top down minds.
30:35
Still, there's a bit of confusion. OK, what is confusing you?
30:47
So it takes a natural number, and after that we have we've got a set,
30:54
so the top three will be something like a natural number to the set of natural language.
31:01
But words matter no to the power set up. No, I can't get that.
31:07
Because it's mapping. OK, I see this guy here is an element of what's said.
31:14
It's an element of this set.
31:27
Yeah, it's an element of the past that because it's a set of it's a set of elements of natural numbers, so it's an element of this set this year.
31:31
Is an actual number, so it's an element of this guy here. So this notation is correct.
31:45
OK, this is what it's saying.
31:54
Let's look at this example here, so it's mapping a natural number X, which is in natural numbers to X plus one, which is also natural, actual numbers.
31:56
Yeah, I understand this because it's from one network to another network slapping a natural number.
32:10
To a subset of natural numbers, so something in the past, that event.
32:18
OK. Agreed. Yeah, maybe.
32:30
Oh, that's a good question, Richard.
32:42
All right. You are quite right, so they should be you have just caught my mistake.
32:45
You have just caught my mistake. Thank you very much, Richard.
33:14
So I still haven't corrected it. OK, Richard, now let's go at.
33:34
Now, it's correct, so thank you.
34:01
I still don't understand Powerset speech. Can you explain them quickly?
34:06
Yes, sir. Powerset is just the set of all subsets of a given set.
34:10
The Powerset is a set of all subsets of a given set.
34:16
Does that make sense? Shweta.
34:27
Does that make sense? So Powerset is a set of all subsets of a set.
34:33
OK, so we have seen this function, the quadratic function and its graph, the parabola.
34:44
So when you programme, we also define functions such as this function square.
34:51
We can programme it in Python as a function.
34:56
We can then call or evaluate this function, so there are functions in mathematics and there are functions in programming to relate to concepts.
35:01
But in programming, it's possible for a function to have multiple inputs such as this function part that Richlands X plus one which gives the output.
35:11
So this function corresponds to the mathematical function.
35:21
Updyke or types are two or so Cartesian product that are without power, or does that make sense?
35:24
Does everybody agree with this? So I've shown you mathematical functions and I've shown you programming functions.
35:33
OK, makes sense. Oh, however, in programming, functions can have side effects, they can,
35:46
for example, output something to the screen, they can send stuff to the database.
35:56
They can they can do all sorts of things. Mathematical functions cannot do this in mathematics.
36:01
We don't consider functions with side effects.
36:07
We are exclusively concerned with inputs and outputs of the function and mathematical function can have no side effects.
36:10
Agreed. OK, so that's the difference between functions in mathematics and functions in programming,
36:19
so we begin this course with a study of functions of type through natural numbers to real numbers that associate real numbers.
36:30
The natural numbers we will call these functions sequences and the outputs will be called terms of such sequences.
36:40
So a sequence is a function from natural numbers, the real numbers that match natural numbers, the real numbers.
36:49
Often it is convenient to define the sequence as a function from positive natural numbers to real numbers.
36:57
So the question is whether we include zero lot. So we have come to sequences and we have run out of time.
37:04
We will carry on. When did you say on Wednesday. Is that right?
37:12
So you see on Wednesday. In terms of the economy, in terms of the Q&A, I still have questions.
37:19
Do you guys still have questions? Do you guys still have questions?
37:31
Are there any questions on the material that we covered last time?
37:43
Feel free to add me to yourselves and feel free.
37:51
Yes, I wanted to ask about the new stuff that you were showing us on on Bitan earlier before you started sequencing.
37:53
Yes. Is so guarantee. I speak for myself, but I don't have much knowledge in that.
38:03
So is this something you would expect me to do over the holidays or is this something that I will eventually learn in the later part of the course?
38:09
So in the later part of the course, you will learn how neural networks are calibrated.
38:16
So the entire idea of we show you the neural network is to motivate calculus, to explain the calibration of the neural network is basically calculus.
38:22
Right? So it's an application of an advanced technique that will discover which is a multivariate change.
38:33
So by the end of the course,
38:40
you understand the multidirectional and I'll show you how the neural network is calibrated so you understand exactly what's going on.
38:42
But it will take the entire course to get that. And OK, so you're not you're not expecting us to have previous knowledge of this, right?
38:49
No, it was probably the first time that I showed you the neural network that you just showed us an application of calculus.
38:59
Is that whatever? Exactly. Exactly. But it's an important example because I will be using this example throughout the course.
39:06
And when we learn the more to the very changeable, we'll come back to this example.
39:14
So hopefully that answers your question. Any other questions? OK, if there are no further questions, we'll press on.
39:25
Can you guys see my slides? Yes.
39:37
OK, so a sequence is simply a function that that is defined the natural numbers, right.
39:43
And some people prefer oh, by the way, when people talk about actual numbers, some people include zero of this.
39:53
Difficult to do. Yet some people say that there is a natural number of the people say that it's not a natural number.
39:59
So that can be quite a little confusion there, especially there is no consistency between mathematics and computer science.
40:06
So when we say that the that we start with one and we will tend to start with what will we work with sequences we will
40:14
tend to write and plus some will write this fancy and plaques to to indicate that we actually starting with one.
40:23
Right. So that it's not super important. But be careful that it's not that it can it can be slightly confusing.
40:32
So a sequence is basically just a function from natural numbers, usually starting with one, two real numbers.
40:40
And the outputs will be called the terms of such a sequence.
40:50
So that's the formal definition of a sequence. OK, let me let me recap.
40:54
Let me recap. This formal definition sequence is a function F and then I give the function type.
41:01
You see, I give the function type from N to R can you see my my cursor.
41:06
Can you see when I move the cursor over the slides.
41:12
Yeah, OK, so from natural numbers to real numbers, so that's the type of this function that maps natural numbers to real numbers.
41:16
Often it is convenient to define a sequence from actually positive natural numbers.
41:25
So starting with one, and that's what we'll be doing in the schools. So I have this 10 plus here, just a little subtlety.
41:31
So we will mostly write this kind of notation for such a sequence is too long winded to be constantly writing functions.
41:37
We will simply be referring terms of a sequence and and it's going to be this F a pen.
41:45
Right. So I'm not going to be constantly writing functions or talking about sequences.
41:53
I'll be just giving you the all I can basically what I can do.
41:57
I can just list the elements of a sequence. Right.
42:00
I can just list the elements of the sequence and and define a sequence in that one.
42:04
So let's just look at some examples of sequences. Right, so a simple sequence is just every natural number is mapped to one,
42:09
so the elements of this function are going to be one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one and so on.
42:21
So now if I were to continue, it would be a very boring course. Do you agree?
42:29
So I'll stop there. OK, so the next sequence is one half a third, quarter a fifth.
42:36
So you actually like that? OK, so we won't do this. It would be a very easy calculus course as well.
42:45
Then I can only then examine you on this one sequence. But we have we see we have dot, dot, dot, which indicates this going on indefinitely.
42:51
Right. This indicates that we have this infinite process of listing the elements of the sequence.
43:02
Dot, dot, dot. So this saves us this saves us doing stuff for an infinite amount of time.
43:07
OK, so we have a different function. So every term is one over in.
43:15
Here is a different sequence and squared minus 10, right?
43:20
And the element that was slightly less obvious, right.
43:25
So it's always a good idea to write down the first few terms of the sequence to get an idea of what the function, what the sequence looks like.
43:28
So the terms of the sequence. So if we start with one one squared, minus one is zero.
43:38
So the first element is zero two squared, minus two is two and so on.
43:43
Right. So these are the elements that we get. Right. Another interesting another interesting sequence.
43:48
We have minus one to the power of. And so when N is even we get one.
43:56
When it's cold, we get minus one. So this sequence is oscillating between minus one and what?
44:05
So here is another fancy sequence that I'm going to define.
44:14
So I'm going to say that FBN is going to be tempted minus six and it's growing and wondering if and is not right.
44:17
Does everyone remember what the prime numbers. OK, excellent.
44:26
So we have this sequence, this kind of sequence and and going back, I mean,
44:32
I'm not really teaching programming in the schools, but sometimes I mean, sometimes sequences may be difficult to solve.
44:40
It's always a good idea to write down the first few terms of a sequence.
44:49
But another good idea is to perhaps plot the first few terms of a sequence.
44:55
So this is what we're going to do.
45:02
So for the sequence, we're going to look at the first in terms of a sequence of the first nine terms, I can't remember exactly.
45:04
But then we basically look at these first few terms of a sequence.
45:15
Right. And then I'm going to plot them. Right. So I want to visualise what the sequence looks like.
45:22
And that's something very easy to do.
45:27
And again, I'm not teaching your programming this course, but it's a good idea to pick up a little bit and to be able to visualise these things.
45:29
Very powerful stuff, so we can visualise stuff, we can plot stuff.
45:36
So for this second sequence that we introduced, one over N right.
45:40
I compute the first few terms and I got them right.
45:45
And this is what it looks like. Right. I get this for.
45:50
Given what does the semicolon do after the comprehension, the semicolon suppresses the output, right,
45:56
because this thing actually outputs some big law, which I don't want to display on the screen yet.
46:04
I only want to display the graph that it returns some string. I don't want to show the string, so I just suppress it.
46:10
So that one put semicolon and then afterwards, oh, this is actually separates different statements like the first statement.
46:17
I define my sequence. Right.
46:25
I could find my sequence using something called Python Lisk apprehension and then I return the sequence.
46:29
Right, because I actually want this thing to return the sequence. I want to show these elements.
46:35
Yeah. Because this thing would just return anything. I actually want to look at it, so I do it here, right?
46:40
That's why that's why I did it. Semicolons, separate statements. Is that clear?
46:49
Yeah. Thank you. OK, so and then I plotted and this is what the one over and looks like, right?
46:57
That's what one over and looks like.
47:04
And this is the next sequence that we plotted, which is and squared minus Ed so that we define now we're plotting it.
47:06
And that's what this sequence looks then at half this minus one to the part of N and look at ski jumping from minus one to one,
47:13
from minus one to one from minus got to one. Of course you can plot it manually, but I just show you how to in them.
47:22
OK, so here is a function that tells us whether a number is prime.
47:29
And this is then we basically use this function to find this sequence, the last example that we had of the slide,
47:34
and this is what it looks like, do you see this is what this sequence looks like.
47:42
So we plot it. It's always a good idea to put stuff if you have a question and blog.
47:50
What is the second document, the oh oh oh, just being the oldest means.
47:58
OK, so let me just let me perhaps let me let me do this, let me let me do this.
48:03
So by default, if I don't put this over, by the way, if I remove this semicolon it will output this object thing which I don't want.
48:10
So this is why I put the semicolon there. So this is going back to the semicolon.
48:21
So now the reason I have this semicolon first, that is because if I just do this, it will do what I want, right.
48:25
It will to these elements, which is fine.
48:34
But if I do this, if I do X equals, it will result in nothing.
48:38
It will return nothing. So I actually wanted to return it. That's why I do this.
48:44
Now, why do I have this circle here?
48:50
Because if I don't put a circle, it will connect all the dots with with a line.
48:53
So it's not very clear. I'm just telling it. Don't block the line. Block the dots.
48:59
Yeah, that's what I'm doing here. Richard, does this answer your question?
49:05
Yeah, thank you so much. OK, there is another question I'm trying to look at.
49:11
There is a hand raised. Can you can you tell me what your question is?
49:15
So it's one of Prime Y in the plot was also like follow the prime O one is not a crime.
49:20
So let me just go back. So one does not one is not a crime, but we plot.
49:30
I mean, it's a you're quite right. Just a second, so.
49:38
One is not a prime. Where did I make a mistake?
49:46
So this should be. Oh, that's right.
49:55
So we've got one over and if it is not a problem, so let me go back to the definition of look, I mean, the definition of the sequence.
49:59
We return 10 to minus six if it is appropriate and we return.
50:07
So we return one over. And if it's not a problem and one is not a problem, so we return one over one, which is what.
50:14
So that is saying precisely that one is not a prime. Thank you.
50:22
Thank you. Yeah, so that's that's that's that's that's that's that's actually so let us look at some some other examples of sequences and.
50:28
Yeah. So one precisely. We have one here because one is not a.
50:42
So we have one over in which is. Well OK, that's that's precisely why we have this thing here.
50:48
OK, so we can have noticed that it doesn't matter which index we use to get Zinnia and you have a question if your hand is OK.
50:54
So you've just sort of. I have no question. OK, no problem.
51:10
So it doesn't matter, you see, which which what we use to index a time series, which what kind of do we call it.
51:13
When do we call it. It doesn't matter. It's only a thing that we use to index a time series.
51:22
So it doesn't really matter what we call it and changing it from end to all, it makes no difference.
51:28
That's just a simple remark. OK, so you might have seen some sequences, such as an arithmetic sequence before.
51:33
Right. And the arithmetic sequence starts with a fixed number, which is called the first one.
51:41
And then all the terms increase by the common difference by D.
51:49
So the end is defined like this. So for example, we have an arithmetic sequence, five seven nine, 11, 13, 15.
51:54
So who can tell me what the first elements of the sequence. What's a one.
52:03
Five, right, and what's the. To do exactly so and you remember this formula, you surely remember this formula from from school, right?
52:11
You can write down the sum of the arithmetic sequence in two ways like this and like this.
52:24
Yeah.
52:32
Then you can add the these two two ways together or the terms containing D will cancel and you end up with just two equals and a one plus eight and.
52:33
Yeah. So you end up and then if you divide by two you get the formula for the sum of the
52:46
first and terms of the arithmetic sequence or also the arithmetic progression.
52:51
Do you guys remember this formula or is the first time you're seeing. OK, excellent.
52:57
So another sequence, the geometric sequence, right, an important, very simple arithmetic sequence,
53:11
only now you're not increasing the terms by D you're multiplying them by oh, which is the common ratio.
53:18
G What's the common difference or is the combination.
53:26
So the terms and also we have some some first term, which is the scale factor which tells us how this whole thing scales like a.
53:30
And then the terms are a R squared cubed to the four and so on.
53:40
And in fact the terms are related to each other through this recursive relation.
53:46
OK, so we can also compute the sum of the first in terms of this, of this.
53:51
Well, actually, we want to be able to compute the sum of the infinite number of terms.
53:58
Right. And we'll see how to do this in this lecture. But we start with a fixed number of terms.
54:03
So we'll write down the sum of equals zero one to help out to the power of two and so on.
54:09
We multiply both sides by one minus R and we notice that many of the terms cancel here.
54:17
When we do this, when we multiply by one minus R and we end up with just a minus day off to the end.
54:24
OK, so the formula is given by a one minus to the end, divided by one minus all.
54:31
That's the sum of the first in terms of the geometric sequence, the sum of the first in terms of the geometric sequence.
54:38
Another example of a sequence. So we've seen the arithmetic sequence.
54:46
We've seen the geometric sequence. Let me give you a really fancy sequence.
54:49
Right. It's possible to specify a sequence recursively where the latitudes are defined in terms of the previously defined terms.
54:54
So, for example, the Fibonacci sequence, the first few terms are going to be the first two terms are going to be zero and one.
55:01
And then we are going to every term is going to be the sum of the previous two.
55:10
OK, that's the Fibonacci sequence. So who can tell me what the third of the next sequence is going to be?
55:16
What's the fourth term going to be? Two and the next one.
55:26
And the next one slice exactly. Exactly.
55:35
So you could there is actually I mean,
55:41
there is actually an encyclopaedia of sequences where you can search for sequences so you can find
55:45
that this is a zero zero zero zero forty five in the online encyclopaedia integer sequences.
55:50
So if you click that, there is there are millions of these sequences on this website.
55:57
So it lists all their properties, all the results of all these sequences.
56:01
So it's an interesting website.
56:05
OK, one authenticity, a sequence is increasing if and plus one is greater than or equal to and full and greater than or equal to one.
56:07
It is decreasing if a plus one is less than or equal to and four and greater than or equal to one.
56:17
The sequence is called monotonic. If it is either increasing or decreasing, doesn't matter which one.
56:23
If it's increasing its military, it's decreasing.
56:29
It's not the notions of strictly of the strictly increasing sequence and strictly decreasing sequence are similarly defined.
56:31
But only we now require strict inequality here, not greater than our equals, but strictly greater.
56:40
OK, so here are some examples.
56:47
The sequence one over again is strictly decreasing. It is therefore decreasing.
56:51
Antiplatelet the secret.
56:55
We have seen the sequences, by the way, in previous examples, the sequence and squared minus N is strictly increasing, strictly increase.
56:57
It is therefore increasing and monotonic, right?
57:07
Yes. So here is a question to you. Is the Fibonacci sequence increasing or decreasing?
57:13
Strictly increasing, strictly decreasing and is it monotonic?
57:19
So the first question, is it increasing? Yeah, yeah, is a decreasing.
57:24
So is it strictly increasing? No, no, no, no.
57:34
Is it strictly decreasing, obviously? Well, is it on it?
57:40
So, yeah, no, there is disagreement.
57:45
So is it monotonic? No. Yes. Well, if it's increasing, it's monotonic.
57:49
It doesn't have to be strictly increasing. If it's increasing its monotonic, if it's decreasing its monotonic.
57:56
So it is monotonic.
58:03
If it is not if it's not strictly breathing, it can still be the only requirement for being monotonic is being increasing or being decreasing.
58:05
So strictly has nothing to do with being monotonic. So there is another raised hand, please ask you a question.
58:15
If you go to the previous slide, what was the subscripts next to the functions where it shows and is greater than or equal to one?
58:26
It just says we are going and is going from one to three, four, five, six, seven and so on.
58:36
So the natural number is just natural. Yes. So it should be I mean, it's basically it's not very clear, right.
58:43
Because it doesn't say and there's a natural number, but it's too long to write and is a natural number and is greater than or equal to what.
58:49
Thank you. No problem. OK, so we have seen this why are sequences incredibly important?
58:58
Because let me let me explain why they're so important at school.
59:08
You have learnt how to solve equations. So you solve equations such as two to the squared, plus four X minus four equals zero.
59:14
So you guys told me what the roots are of this equation.
59:22
But if we have something like Koslov X equals X cubed, it's much, much more difficult to solve this equation.
59:26
And therefore we have to use a numerical method to solve this equation, such as Newton's method, which you will see in this course.
59:33
Now, we will study this in in great detail.
59:40
But what I'm going to say that to solve many equations that are important in real life, we don't have a formula.
59:44
So we have to use the numerical methods. We have to use some procedure that is approximate.
59:51
Right. And that will give us successive approximations to the root of this equation.
59:56
So how do we solve course of X equals excuse? Well, we write down we can write down this as a function of X minus X cubed.
1:00:02
We write down the derivative of this function, which is minus sign of X, minus three squared squared.
1:00:12
And then we apply Newton's method, which you guys haven't seen yet.
1:00:18
We will talk about this in great detail in the school. So wait for us to arrive at that.
1:00:23
But basically, look, when you apply Newton's method, it's an iterative procedure.
1:00:28
You end up with various answers. Right.
1:00:34
And what do you notice? What do the answers form? What do the approximate solutions to this equation for?
1:00:38
A sequence exactly, and not just any sequence, look what happens.
1:00:52
Look, look at what happens to the sequence. It gets closer.
1:00:57
You have to go. It's decreasing. It is.
1:01:01
Well, it may be decreasing, it may be oscillating, it's actually oscillating, converging.
1:01:06
It converges to some numbers. Do you see that? It converges to the true answer.
1:01:13
It converges to the true answer.
1:01:19
So, yes, you can think of Newton's method to say that expansion, but will come back to that in great detail later in this course.
1:01:22
But it converges to the true answer. Well, we wanted to converge to the true answer.
1:01:28
Otherwise, why would we be doing all this right? We want the sequence of answers to converge to the true solution.
1:01:33
So this is a hugely important what do we mean by converge? Right.
1:01:40
It's a fancy word. I don't know what converge means. What we can see that digits stabilise.
1:01:45
Do you see the digits stabilise?
1:01:51
They become fixed that it looks like some number is beginning to emerge from the sequence, the true answer, the true solution.
1:01:54
I don't I mean, there is a downside. How do we programme, because I don't really we are not going to be examining your own programming.
1:02:08
So you will be doing this stuff by hand. But Python is very useful for doing this kind of thing.
1:02:14
So Python is very useful for doing this kind of thing. But we will not be examining.
1:02:19
But you can use Python to implement this Python exams as well.
1:02:24
Not in the exam. Not in the exam. Right.
1:02:30
I'm just show you that Python is very powerful for performing this kind of analysis.
1:02:34
So what do we mean by converge? I haven't yet actually told you what we mean by Kiddush.
1:02:38
Here is another example. When we train a neural network, the neural network has these weights, which are just numbers.
1:02:44
And when we train the neural network, these weights need to stabilise.
1:02:52
So we have actually a sequence of weights as we carry on training.
1:02:57
The neural nets with these weights begin to stabilise and approach some fixed number.
1:03:01
Right. They begin to stabilise and we want the weights to converge as well.
1:03:08
We want them to conclude as to the true optimal weight, which gives us the the weight that we need.
1:03:12
Right. But sometimes we may get the local optimum, which is not ideal, which, of course, we want the global optimum.
1:03:19
But anyway, we are running ahead of ourselves. Here is another reason why sequences are important.
1:03:26
If you think of a real number, we know that every real number has a decimal expansion so we can write it down as a decimal fraction.
1:03:31
Well, this is actually a sum of zero plus B one divided by ten plus B two divided by ten squared plus B three divided by ten squared.
1:03:38
So we might as well well for this to actually be the eight a real number.
1:03:48
This sequence has to converge to that number. Otherwise this sum doesn't make sense.
1:03:54
The decimal expansion of the decimal expression wouldn't make sense. OK, so these are just a couple of examples.
1:03:59
Why sequences, why sequences are extremely important, right?
1:04:05
Why sequences are extremely important. Let me ask you a question now that we are talking about convergence,
1:04:13
two bulldozers are moving towards each other at a speed of one mile per hour on a collision course.
1:04:21
When they started, they were one mile apart and the bee was pushed on the front of one of the B began to
1:04:28
fly back and forth between the bulldozers at a constant speed of two miles per hour,
1:04:35
vainly seeking to avoid his fate. How far from his starting point will the unfortunate insect be crushed?
1:04:41
Who can tell? Half a mile, half a mile wide.
1:04:49
Because the bulldozers are moving at the same time. Yeah, but in the end, we will be in this area in the centre only as an average.
1:04:59
It'll keep going across. But I'm ability to stay in the central and get crushed symmetrically.
1:05:07
Absolutely. They're moving at constant speed and it's going to be crushed when they collide.
1:05:12
Now, when I ask this question, the Middle East is usually closed in the hope that the victim of the riddle.
1:05:17
So you guys were tricked. You gave me the answer straightaway.
1:05:24
But if you didn't understand that, it's actually it's actually here that this happens, that the paedos.
1:05:28
So this actually could be you could start writing things down.
1:05:37
OK, after let us basically let us it's let's write down what the B is going to be an H.
1:05:44
You're absolutely you're absolutely correct.
1:05:53
It's going to be one half mile.
1:05:57
But let us actually write down what the B is going to be after the first letter of the first landing from its position.
1:05:59
Where is it going to be? What's this?
1:06:05
Two thirds, two thirds. And what about the second landing?
1:06:16
Minus the third, so it's going to be two thirds, minus two to three, minus two ninth degree.
1:06:23
Yeah. And what about the next one?
1:06:33
Two thirds minus two ninth, plus two twenty seven. And the next one and the next one, again, could issue the figure.
1:06:44
So two thirds, minus two nine. Plus, what's that going to be?
1:06:57
Twenty seven. So it's always going to be one of the three, the previous number.
1:07:07
Thanks to. Does it make sense?
1:07:20
Can you simplify this expression? So and by the way, do it what what should this extend as intense to infinity be equal to?
1:07:41
What what what must it be equal to? Exactly.
1:07:50
So how can we get a half out of this thing? So let us simplify this expression first.
1:07:56
How can you simplify this expression? What can you do straightaway?
1:08:03
Take two and one, let maybe take it out of the brackets, two thirds, take it out of the bracket brackets,
1:08:09
then you end up with one plus minus a third plus one is the third through the power of two plus two.
1:08:17
So where have we seen this sequence before?
1:08:24
And you might think it's a geometric progression. And what can we do with a geometric progression?
1:08:31
It to infinity and carry all this up. Well, we don't we don't have to do it just to get to infinity, but we can sum it.
1:08:39
We we derive the formula for the sum of the geometric progression.
1:08:48
You agree? So, yes.
1:08:53
Thank you very much for this anecdote, Troy. I have heard the same anecdotes, but about Gousse.
1:09:06
So I'm not sure, so people keep keep saying that basically this famous mathematician was asked to sum
1:09:14
the geometrical arithmetic progression and he came up with the answer straight away.
1:09:20
And the way this can be done is precisely what I'm showing on the slides.
1:09:25
These are the tricks for summing the arithmetic progression and for something, the geometric progression.
1:09:30
This gives us this formula. Right. So we can apply this formula.
1:09:38
We can apply this formula. You can apply this formula and and what do we get, we get this.
1:09:45
We get this, so we have the some of the geometric progression, which is equal to this.
1:09:58
So how do we get to half from this, who can tell me?
1:10:04
And my sister-in-law exactly.
1:10:11
So this thing minus the three, minus three to the power and what becomes really big, this thing becomes really small.
1:10:16
OK, so it vanishes. But this is all a bit imprecise.
1:10:26
So it's a big handwaving. So it's exactly correct.
1:10:30
What you are saying this minus the third to the power and we'll get closer and
1:10:36
closer to zero and therefore the answer will get closer and closer to a half.
1:10:41
So we managed to get the same answer in two different ways.
1:10:47
The intuitive way and and the.
1:10:51
So is it about four new toys and. So is it about 4:00 a.m.?
1:10:56
That's interesting, that's an interesting anecdote, actually. So take a deep breath.
1:11:05
You're about to learn the most important definition of analysis, so you'll need to understand it well.
1:11:22
That's an. And greater than or equal to one be a sequence,
1:11:32
this sequence will converge to limit it all if the following statement can be shown to be true for all epsilon greater than zero.
1:11:38
So Epsilon is a real number, positive, real number. We can find a N in natural numbers such that for all and greater than an.
1:11:48
This distance here between eight and 12 is going to be less than absolute, and that is what we mean by convergence.
1:11:59
We also say that it means convergence to the limit.
1:12:10
We can write it down like this or we can write it down like this, doesn't matter which notation you prefer,
1:12:14
the most important thing is that you understand this definition.
1:12:21
It's something like some Epsilon 30 language.
1:12:29
It's exactly the Epsilon Delta language. It's exactly the Epsilon Delta language.
1:12:33
So let us understand this first letter.
1:12:39
So this statement about convergence to a limit is best understood by taking the last spot first and working backwards.
1:12:45
So we have here the limit inequality. There it is, we have here the limit inequality,
1:12:54
which says that the distance from the anthem in the sequence to the limit should be less than absolute.
1:13:03
Right? Then we say for all. And.
1:13:09
Greater than capitaland throw a little greater than CapitaLand, that should be some point capitalism,
1:13:15
after which every single term and in the sequence is with an absolute over the limit.
1:13:22
So so this inequality holds for all of these points.
1:13:28
OK, and then working backwards, we need this for any absolute greater than zero.
1:13:34
So no matter what the value of Epsilon we pick, however tiny,
1:13:41
we will still be able to find some value capital n such that all the forms to
1:13:46
the right of a capital and in that sequence with an excellent of the limit.
1:13:51
Any questions? So.
1:13:58
Let's look at the definition again for all excellent greater than zero, we find we can find a and in capital and so let us actually let us.
1:14:18
Let's look at the particular sequence here. Right, the sequence is one over.
1:14:44
This particular sequence, one over. Yeah, can you see the sequence one over?
1:14:51
You can put it in Python if you like. You can look at it, do you think that the sequence converges?
1:14:59
Yes, what does it do to zero?
1:15:06
Exactly. So let us actually check this formally.
1:15:10
Let us prove this formally, right? So consider the sequence and equals one over it.
1:15:14
So the game is to find a value of N for whatever value of Epsilon is chosen.
1:15:22
So if it converges to zero, then it pays to get arbitrarily close to zero.
1:15:30
Right. As close as if we say does it get this close to zero.
1:15:36
The answer should be yes. Does it get at this close to zero?
1:15:42
The answer should be yes. Does it get this close to zero? The answer should be yes.
1:15:46
If it converges right, this is get this close to zero.
1:15:51
The answer should be yes. So this is the thing that I'm actually picking here is the absolute how close to zero does it get?
1:15:54
So for an arbitrary epsilon, for the arbitrary distance from zero, it should get arbitrarily close to zero.
1:16:03
Right. So I should be able to pick any epsilon and I should be able to show that the limit inequality is satisfied.
1:16:10
OK, so let me pick a particular value of Epsilon.
1:16:19
Let me pick a particular value of excellence and let's say, can we show that it gets within zero point to eight of zero?
1:16:26
Right, can we show that it gets within zero point to zero,
1:16:36
so we need to show that for absolutely equal to zero point to eight, we can apply the this inequality, right.
1:16:40
And my mine is less than excellent, so this is, by the way, the distance,
1:16:51
this thing in the modular side and my muscle is the distance between then and the limit.
1:16:56
Now, what is our limited this example? Zero zero.
1:17:05
OK, so the oil disappears, so we just have and the end is what?
1:17:13
Well, no one over and so we our inequality becomes one over and is less than excellent,
1:17:20
but we picked a specific episode, which is zero point twenty eight, right.
1:17:26
So we have this modulars one over in is less than zero point to act like this modulus of one over in is less than zero point to it.
1:17:30
And what does it mean? It means one, our own is less than zero point two eight because it is actually positive.
1:17:42
It's an index. And that means is one is greater than one or zero point two, eight and 10 is greater than three point five seven one four.
1:17:48
OK, so you've actually told us how far into the sequence we need to get to get within zero point two eight of the episode.
1:18:00
Do you see that? Yes, OK, but can we actually is there an element, three point five seven one four in the sequence?
1:18:09
Is that three point five seven third element in the sequence?
1:18:25
No. So which element do we take for the fourth one?
1:18:30
Right,
1:18:37
so we take any capital and equals to four and then the shows that all the terms after the fourth to actually get within this distance of the accident.
1:18:38
And that is required by the definition of convergence to all the terms after the fourth one will be within this.
1:18:51
Absolutely right. Because we have shown this look, we have shown this in this inequality yet.
1:19:00
Well, I have a question about like maybe some sequels could approach you in two
1:19:09
directions of only one direction so far as our Kaskowitz do use this approach to.
1:19:14
You mean it's doing this? Yeah. Yes. This this definition still works.
1:19:20
So it still gets noticed that this is actually looking at the distance on both sides, right?
1:19:26
We take this modular sign, right, so it's the distancia. Right, the episode needs to be over here, so it was OK.
1:19:35
There is another question, someone has raised their hand, if that's what they decide, and then value for it to still be the greatest.
1:19:46
And we need to be careful with a strictly greater or not strictly greater right.
1:19:57
The definition is this right. So the definition that we need to satisfy and needs to be strictly for all in strictly greater
1:20:03
than and I think the definition would work if we replace this with greater than our equals.
1:20:12
But let us work with the definitions that we are given. I think it's equivalent.
1:20:17
So, yes, I question is this true only for decreasing functions,
1:20:25
whatever the function is increasing and trying to get to some level which could increase an approach limit like this.
1:20:30
It still works. So it could go like this, like this, like this.
1:20:36
And it will get within Epsilon of the limit. It doesn't have to be decreasing.
1:20:40
OK, it can be oscillating around the limit, but getting closer to the limit, the same definition will apply.
1:20:46
But it always would be greater than capitaland, yes, for all and greater the capitalism, it needs to be within this bounds within this belt.
1:20:54
There is another question. The proof that they absolutely value values a and minus is a decreasing function to prove that it converges.
1:21:07
It doesn't. Well, it doesn't have to be decreasing function.
1:21:22
Well, wait, wait, wait. It doesn't have to be a decreasing function.
1:21:26
Because consider this sequence. Consider a sequence that does.
1:21:41
Consider perhaps what if you consider something like E to the buttocks?
1:21:50
Each of the power of X, the graph converges to the left, not to the right, so I'm just thinking take a mixture of two sequences.
1:21:56
So you have a sequence as this. Right, a sign of a sign of X over X, right, sign of what we're dealing with natural numbers as a sign of,
1:22:04
we will look at convergence for functions as well, but we can mix together two sequences like one of our own.
1:22:15
Actually, let's take 10 times. Let me let me let me let me cook a sequence for you.
1:22:23
Let me cook a sequence for you. Basically, let me go back to Python.
1:22:31
So I think that Python can be quite useful in this case. And let me cook a sequence that does something like this.
1:22:37
Right. So let's say let's say.
1:22:56
And times. Sign of an.
1:23:10
That's what this. Oh, so this is diverging, so let's let's actually let's actually do this divide by 10.
1:23:23
OK, so something like this, so this is still convergent, right?
1:23:51
So. So still convergent.
1:23:57
Like that. Yup. We can actually take a loss, so this is if if if is even.
1:24:03
And we can take four if 10 is called. Something like this.
1:24:22
So you see, it's no longer strictly decreasing function. This distance.
1:24:37
Agree. So both the original function and the distance can both be not strictly increasing or decreasing, but we can still get coverage.
1:24:45
And look at this, it's still Convergys. It's not a strictly decreasing function.
1:24:58
OK, thanks. You see this example, the distance is no longer strictly decreasing function,
1:25:07
but if we take if we go to the limit, if we go to the limit, did you see the function that I that I cooked?
1:25:14
Yeah, I did catch up with Mike Pace, the condition being sufficient, but not necessary condition.
1:25:23
I think it still satisfies the conditions for convergence, this is this condition is a necessary condition.
1:25:31
All right. OK, OK. I think it's a necessary condition for convergence.
1:25:41
It's it's a necessary and sufficient condition, it's a definition, right?
1:25:50
So if and only if. So let me give you a few more definitions, so you need to spend quite a bit of time with this stuff.
1:25:54
I think there is another question similar. Hey, maybe for better example,
1:26:08
you could use something like excuse graph that where we're actually and you divide by that
1:26:15
by the function such that the there are parts where your sequence actually grows bigger.
1:26:23
But eventually Comverse,
1:26:30
I think that they can demonstrate that distance doesn't necessarily have to be decreasing except for when N approaches infinity.
1:26:32
Is that. Exactly. Exactly. That's that's what I'm trying to show as well.
1:26:41
Right. So you can. You can. That's a good example as well.
1:26:45
OK, so there are a few more definitions, the sequence converges to infinity, if and only if.
1:26:53
All in all,
1:27:01
there is an end in end such that for all and greater than or equal to end with half and is greater than we right the limit of and is infinity.
1:27:02
So here that we have to get within Epsilon of some L here, we just need to get arbitrarily, arbitrarily large.
1:27:14
So whichever you pick we can exceed all for all and greater than or equal to any.
1:27:24
So the sequence converges to minus infinity, if it can get arbitrarily negatively watch.
1:27:34
Right. So for all I know, there is an end in such that for all and greater than or equal to end capital capitalism, we have and is less than all.
1:27:40
So it gets arbitrarily small. The sequence converges, if it converges either to a real number to illimitable or to infinity or to minus infinity,
1:27:52
and it diverges if it doesn't converge. Right.
1:28:04
So this is. No, a convergence to infinity is not the same as divergence, divergence means it doesn't condone serial number,
1:28:08
it doesn't converge to infinity and it doesn't converge to minus.
1:28:26
So we need to basically live by these definitions. So a convergence to infinity is not a religious.
1:28:31
Right, that is, Muhammet, I'm answering your question about.
1:28:43
So could you then give examples of functions that diverge, but don't go to infinity or to minus infinity, minus one to the power of an.
1:28:48
It just oscillates between minus one and one, minus one and one, so it doesn't converge to a limit.
1:28:59
It doesn't converge to infinity. It doesn't converge to infinity.
1:29:06
So it's a divergent sequence sign off and right as well.
1:29:12
So how can Subsequence converge if it is either going to infinity or minus infinity,
1:29:22
since that does not define what it converges to infinity, the stable value is it?
1:29:26
It converges to infinity, right? It's not the same as Kaloogian.
1:29:32
Still it is. It's a different definition. If the definition of convergence to infinity.
1:29:37
Look at these different issues. Well, we already have Epsilon, but whereas Delta.
1:29:45
OK, the delta will come when we consider function limits of functions and continuity of functions rather than sequences.
1:29:53
The delta will come.
1:30:02
But the reason why these definitions are so important is because there are many definitions in analysis which are very similar to these definitions.
1:30:04
So we will see the Epsilon and Delta, so.
1:30:12
OK, any other questions? Any other questions?
1:30:38
We have just seen the most important definition in all of analysis and calculus.
1:30:49
So you really need to understand this definition spent quite a bit of time looking at examples.
1:30:54
Right. And really understand this definition. All right, we've run out of time.
1:31:00
I hope you've enjoyed this lecture and I'll see you.
1:31:13
When do I see you next? What do I see you next, is it is it on Monday?
1:31:17
But you may still have the MMT. Thank you very much.
1:31:28
Just one question. Are there any books that you would recommend us to read which could help us understand sequences better?
1:31:34
So the book I would recommend to read is the book by being more.
1:31:42
Let me let me actually let me find this for just a second.
1:31:47
So the book that I recommend that you read is.
1:31:51
Is this one? It has some good examples there.
1:31:59
It's. The book that explains this stuff very well with lots of examples is mathematical analysis, a straightforward approach.
1:32:06
The medical analysis is straightforward approach that it's its fiscal.
1:32:20
Is this just a second, so I would recommend that you read this.
1:32:26
Now, this.
1:32:33
Mathematical analysis, a straightforward approach. OK, thank you.
1:32:43
Any other questions? I had a quick question if that's OK.
1:32:57
You mentioned anti's.
1:33:06
MMD, if we haven't heard from NMT yet, should we email them or is that sort of like we haven't heard from MMT and it hasn't been scheduled,
1:33:11
but can you email me actually and tell me that this is happening? So it's called the Imperial, because then it's something as well.
1:33:20
Great. Thank you. Yeah, let's let's sort this out.
1:33:31
I see there is another raised hand. Any other questions?
1:33:37
If the MMT group no, same as Deepti.
1:33:49
I think. I'm not sure, actually.
1:33:56
OK, I'll check my email.
1:34:06
OK, if they will, that would be good for me. I can't remember if it's the same or not.
1:34:10
OK, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Any other questions?
1:34:15
Yes, I have a quick question, Bill, so if we can use this formula doesn't mean that the sequence is convergent in orange.
1:34:23
In all range, well, it says that the numbers get close to the limit for all elements after the element.
1:34:38
Right, so at some point in the sequence, at some point in the sequence, they all within this bounds, all that, all that, all the points.
1:34:49
Right, does that answer your question?
1:35:01
Well, I was thinking like, OK, Tenjin X Factor X, this is a this is a real this is a function to find the real it's not a sequence.
1:35:04
Are you thinking of dungeons and. Of the of the so let me let me check.
1:35:16
Oh, you're you're basically saying it's periodic. Is that what you saying?
1:35:26
No, I was thinking like it seems like a coincidence to two Lamis.
1:35:31
Oh, because just a second. So what you are to say, I see you are saying.
1:35:40
You are saying? You are saying?
1:35:47
You are saying something like this. By the way, if you have to go through to the next lecture, then then go to the next lecture.
1:36:00
So if you have another another thing, I don't want to be holding you up, but you are saying that you have a sequence, which is.
1:36:09
Now, OK, well, that's that's. Uh.
1:36:40
That looks to be like a convergence sequence. OK, so what is why why are you saying for Alridge?
1:36:57
Because I remember that the for attention was like minus one to one, but it.
1:37:08
Yeah. Just a second.
1:37:18
So Ahmadinejad. The tangent has the domain of all real numbers.
1:37:42
So Ahmadinejad is defined for all the real numbers. So I think you're confusing this with.
1:37:53
Something like. An odd sign or an art course, which is only defined between minus one and one.
1:38:05
Our tangent is defined for all the numbers. So doesn't mean that is conversion for or X.
1:38:14
So for all positive and practical, to think of it as a sequence, right,
1:38:30
if we think of the sequence of an ED, it looks like the sequence is converging to Piloto.
1:38:38
So I don't see the sequence, so when we're talking about sequence, we don't consider it an negative part.
1:38:47
No, no. By definition, the sequence is a function from positive, from positive natural numbers that we don't get into the negative.
1:38:56
But. OK, thank you very much.
1:39:05
When we talk about sequences, the sequence is only defined for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and so on and on the images.
1:39:08
We will like to look at the limits of functions. Right,
1:39:15
we will later look at the limits of functions and then we will have different
1:39:19
limits as we go towards negative infinity and as we go towards different things.
1:39:24
Right. So that's that will come what we consider limits of functions.
1:39:30
OK, thank you very much for the ride. No problem. Any other questions?
1:39:36
No more questions. OK, enjoy the rest of your lectures.
1:39:49
