Title: 2.3 Hamiltonian paths

So the oil the path problem is about whether we can find a path that uses every arc exactly once.
0:01
Let's contrast that with the Hamiltonian path problem, which says, can we find a path that visits every node exactly once?
0:09
And we'll call a path of visits every node. Exactly.
0:18
Once a Hamiltonian path and assembly will have an Hamiltonians circuit, which is a Hamiltonian path that returns to the start node.
0:20
So in this example graph, we have a Hamiltonian path one, two, three, four, five.
0:29
And but there is pretty obviously no Hamiltonian circuit.
0:35
Why is that? Because if we want to get out into one and out of one again, we have to go via two.
0:39
So that means that two would have to be use twice. Which is not allowed. So there's no point in considering parallel arcs and loops here because.
0:46
You're never going to follow a loop because then you would repeat the note and you never get to follow in more than one arc between two no's again,
0:58
because you're not allowed to repeat notes. So let's just restrict ourselves to simple graphs for the Hamiltonian circuit problem.
1:04
And it says, given a graph, determine whether or not that graph has a Hamiltonian circuit.
1:11
Well, what can we say about Hamiltonian paths? Well, obviously, the graph must be connected for the Hamiltonian past to exist.
1:20
We can say that is certainly a necessary condition. What about the Hamiltonian circuit?
1:27
Well, we just saw that having a node degree one was bad news because that node would have to be visited before and after.
1:33
Well, you'd have to visit its neighbour before and after. So that would not be possible.
1:46
So we can say immediately, therefore, that for Hamiltonians circuit to exist, the graph must be connected.
1:51
And each node must have degree, at least two.
1:57
But that's not sufficient either. And here is the graph where it is connected.
2:01
Every node has degree, at least two, but it's not too hard to see that there is no Hamiltonians circuit here.
2:07
So, for instance, if we start at one, then we might as well go to two.
2:15
Then we've got a choice of three or five. But they're both symmetric. Also, let's say we go to three now.
2:21
Then we have to go to four and then we have to go to five.
2:27
And then we're stuck. So there is no Hamiltonian circuit here.
2:32
Of course, there is a Hamiltonian path. One, two, three, four, five. That would work.
2:37
Well, so, okay, we could look in more in detail into that,
2:44
but the best naively that we could think of doing here would be to solve this problem by brute force, by just checking every possible circuit.
2:49
So Hamiltonians ergy just is a permutation of the nodes which forms a path.
3:00
So we could go in in the case of this graph here.
3:07
We could go through each of the permutations. So we could try one, two, three, four, five.
3:11
Well, that's a path as far as five. But then we've got to get back to one. And there is no art from five to one.
3:17
Similarly, if I go to one, three, four, five.
3:23
Well, that's a permutation, but there's no arc from one to three. So that's not a valid Hamiltonian circuit either.
3:26
So the question is, how long with this?
3:34
Take us with N nodes. Well, let's just just to clarify.
3:38
A possible circuit corresponds to a permutation of the nodes and a permutation is a bijection from the numbers of the nodes to themselves.
3:44
Okay. Call that PI and to be an actual circuit.
3:54
We must not just have a A bijection, but we must also have that PI is adjacent to PI plus one for each of I equals one to N where
3:58
and plus one is taken to be one for convenience so that we get back to the start node.
4:09
So the possible circuit, five, four, three, one, two, five, four, three, one, two.
4:16
That corresponds to this permutation given, but it's not a circuit because the PI three, in other words, the three is not adjacent to the PI four.
4:24
In other words, the one like that. Well, checking each of these possible circuits like the five, four, three, one, two can be done quite easily.
4:33
You see using the Arason see Matrix. So we could say that that can be done in Big Owren.
4:43
So each circuit that's fine. But the bad news is that there's N factorial, possible permutations.
4:49
So therefore, in vectorial possible circuits.
4:57
And so that's much too slow because going through each of those, that's going to take us exponential time.
5:01
Of course, we solved this example here negatively, quite easily.
5:09
But in general, we might have to go to N factorial through the N factorial permutations, and that would be bad news.
5:15
Well, actually, it's not quite as bad as N factorial because slightly less naive method,
5:27
a dynamic programming method can solve the Hamiltonian circuit problem in time.
5:33
Bigo of N squared. Two to the N. That's still exponential.
5:40
But of course, it is better than N factorial. And this algorithm is due to Bellmon held in Karp.
5:44
And I'll discuss that later in the course. So the complexity of the Hamiltonian circuit problem, in other words, the running,
5:50
the time needed to solve that problem in the worst case is much greater than that of the owner path problem.
6:01
So there's quite a strong contrast between the two problems. I want us there and we can solve the owner path problem in polynomial time.
6:08
In fact, big out events squared.
6:16
All we have to do is to count, to look at their degrees in the adjacency matrix and cheque that they're all eve and all that are the maximum.
6:18
Two of them are odd. And on the other hand,
6:27
they held Tony in search of a problem using the Bellmon held Karpe algorithm seems to require bingo and squared two times two to the N.
6:31
Which is certainly not polynomial. And in fact,
6:40
there's good reason to think that the Hamiltonian circuit problem cannot be
6:45
solved in polynomial time because it has been shown to be ENPI complete ENP,
6:48
complete problems are believed not to be solvable in polynomial time.
6:55
In other words, they cannot be solved in time. Bego of to the K.
7:01
For any K. And I'm going to come on to discuss N.P. completeness later in the course.
