Title: Induction over Numbers - 2
Category: 1 - Induction over Numbers
Lecturer: Sophia Drossopoulou
Date: 23/01/2021
Welcome back. We will not discuss a second example where we will be applying proof by induction.
0:02
We will want to prove that for all numbers, seven pools of N plus five is exactly divisible by three.
0:10
And a way to formulated these to say for all numbers and there exists an M such that seven to one and plus five is three times N.
0:19
So this is a property that is, again, starts with a universal quantifiers.
0:31
And the quantifier applies to the naturally numbers and therefore we expect to be able to be to prove it by induction.
0:37
Again, I would like you not to write the induction principally for this particular property.
0:46
In order to do that, we concentrate on what is the property we want to prove the property of an ease,
0:57
that there exists an M such that seven to the power of N plus five is easy times and.
1:07
And when we apply this to the generic principle,
1:20
we need to translate fee of zero to that form of here so that we say that exists an M such that seven to the power of zero plus five is three times M.
1:25
And now we want that. We want to assert that for all gay.
1:43
If Beyonc holds, then be of one.
1:50
And that we look as follows, we will say, for all K out of the natural numbers.
1:55
B of K. So that exists, let's call it M one, so that the seven to the power of K plus five is three times and one that complies P of Cape plus one.
2:04
So again, I'm looking here at the property. Over N.
2:19
That can, of course, say there is an end to so that the seven to the K plus one plus five is three times and two.
2:29
And all this will imply for all an and out of the natural numbers.
2:43
B of. N so seven to the bottom end plus five, these three, whoops, sorry I made a mistake.
2:52
So for all an out of the natural numbers, there exists an M.
3:12
Again, out of the natural numbers of the seven to the N plus five is equal with three times N.
3:18
And here I have highlighted in yellow the location where we are replaced and by a particular value.
3:29
So here we have got the property for zero and therefore we talk about seven out of zero.
3:36
Here we have the property for gay and therefore in the left hand side of the implication.
3:45
We talk about seven to the gay, whereas here we have K plus one.
3:52
And therefore the rights inside of an implication, we talk about seven to the gay plus one.
3:57
And in the conclusion and then we talk about seven to the power of N.
4:02
Here I have the inductive principally for this assertion written in Neatly and Ready.
4:10
And it will be in the footnotes. And I would like to point out to you that here I have decided to use the same name for the existential quantifier,
4:21
even the base case in the left hand side of the implication.
4:33
And in the conclusion. And here I decided to use a different name in prime.
4:39
The reason is that the name that we're using here doesn't matter because the scope of this name,
4:48
the visibility of this name is only within the what follows the existential quantifier.
4:55
And therefore, what I call this one does not affect what what I call this one does not affect what I call the other one.
5:02
If there are any questions about that, we can discuss it in our Tuesday session.
5:12
Oh, we would like to develop the proof for the property that we had earlier.
5:17
And in order to develop it, we remember the prints that we have derived earlier on the prints to prove says.
5:25
There exists an M so that Saddam to the power of zero plus five equals three times N and.
5:35
For all, Kay, if there exists an MSO that seven does a bar of K plus five times and then there exists and then prime.
5:42
So that the seven to the K plus one plus five is three times in prime.
5:52
What I want you to do is given that we have developed the principle, I want you to develop the schema.
5:58
For the schema in the base case, we need to prove exactly what is written in the first part of the conjunction and for the inductive step as before.
6:08
For the existing, in order to prove something that has stopped with an existential quantifier, we take an arbitrary K.
6:21
Then we assume in the inductive hypothesis, the left hand side of the implication.
6:29
And we have to show the right hand side of the implication.
6:36
Now we have set up the schema. This is a pretty mechanical step.
6:42
If there are any questions, please let's discuss them either in Piazza or on Tuesday.
6:48
So now we move on to the proof and we will first discuss the base case and then bring back the ship again.
6:56
Please have a go. In the base case, what we have to show is this assertion.
7:03
So what I want to be able to say is at some point at the end of my proof that the there exists an M.
7:17
So that seven to the bottom zero plus five is three times M.
7:25
But they have not shown up yet. So in order to show it, we start with manipulating what I was given seven to zero plus five is one plus five.
7:31
And that is by definition of power. And this is, again, a six.
7:44
By arithmetic, and this is two times three by arithmetic.
7:52
And now I can prove what I wanted to prove.
8:01
Now. Namely because.
8:07
Seven to the zero plus five is two times three.
8:16
And if I take em to be two more, then I know that there exists an am such that seven to zero plus five is three times in.
8:20
So I'm now done with a base case. And here is how the base case looks in your footnotes, which you will be obtaining after this lecture on Tuesday.
8:33
And now we want to prove inductive step. And what we have to prove in the inductive step we already saw earlier when we developed the schema,
8:48
non thinking needs to happen would just write it up.
8:57
And we need to feel the proof for the inductive step.
9:01
Please try to do it and stop the video and come that come back when you have done.
9:09
This proof has got a little bit of a challenge because we need to deal with the existential quantifiers.
9:18
And if you are unclear about how to do it, we will be discussing it right now.
9:25
So let's start thinking again. What I want to be able to stay in the end is there exists and then prime.
9:30
Such that that seven to the power of Kate plus one plus five is three times and prime.
9:40
But the problem is that we do not know how to justify that.
9:49
We. We should start with the left hand side.
9:54
So start with seven to the game, plus one plus five.
9:59
Right. So this we know immediately this is seven to locate them, seven plus five.
10:04
And that is by definition of power.
10:12
Then we will apply several other RiskMetrics properties and we hope.
10:19
That we will reach a term that contains some elements, but it should also contain that, it should also contain seven to the K plus five.
10:27
The reason I wanted to contain seven to the K plus five is because I want to apply the induction hypothesis.
10:40
So I'm not really sure how I will reach this assertion, but once I have reached the last line, I can apply the induction hypothesis.
10:49
The question is, how do I apply the induction hypothesis, because the induction hypothesis is not an equation.
11:00
It starts with an existential quantifier. What I can do is I can apply the induction hypothesis earlier.
11:07
So here I can say that seven to the K plus five equals three times a particle murder and one.
11:18
For some AM one, and this holds by indexical hypothesis.
11:29
So I apply the induction hypothesis earlier, I say I know that there is some.
11:36
And one that will do the job for me. We call this assertion A.
11:41
And here I'm not applying the induction hypothesis. I am applying a.
11:47
So this does not will be reduced to whatever it was before.
11:52
Plus three times and one.
11:57
And then I hope to get to something that will have the form three times.
12:02
Something else. And this is exactly what we have in the fully written proof.
12:08
I'm going to go through it now again. Here in this line,
12:15
we apply the induction hypothesis and we find a particular order and one that has got the property that the three times and one eight seven two,
12:24
the K plus five. Then we start with a seven to the plus one plus five, we apply values.
12:35
Alex made Matic equations, which I'm not going to go through.
12:45
You can cheque it afterwards. But the important thing is that here we arrive at a letter that says seven to the K plus five.
12:50
And now we can apply our induction hypothesis through the assertion, eh, here.
13:00
So we apply the assertion, A, which allows me to replace this term by three times and plus one.
13:09
Now I have got a term that says three times to do the seven plus scale plus three times and plus one here.
13:16
They are both month piece of city. I can factor them out and I have got something that has got the format.
13:25
Three times. Something else. This is the multiple of three that I need and that allows me to arrive to the final assertion.
13:36
And again. I have finished the proof.
13:48
Any questions or comments, we can address them on Tuesday at our session or on Piazza?
13:57
Thank you.
