We now build upon the basic air modelling constructs presented in the previous topic to present a number of extended modelling constructs.
0:02
The first one is to introduce the idea of generalisation hierarchies,
0:13
which extends the concept of subset to include the idea of subsets being disjoint from each other.
0:18
So we have in generalisation hierarchy a number of entities which are all subsets of some other entity and are all disjoint from each other.
0:27
We identified these where we have specialisation of nouns, where we're told that the specialisations are distinct from each other.
0:40
For example, with other description:A employees may be divided according to how they like to receive messages into email users and none email users.
0:47
Both email users and none email users are subsets of person,
0:56
but we can also say that they're just joint each from each other because we're saying we're going to divide the people and
1:01
therefore we can put them into a generalisation hockey where we say that the email users are disjointed from the email users.
1:07
Try out a quiz question which looks at identifying which extents of a database are not permitted.
1:18
When I have a generalisation hierarchy. And the most popular answer for this is Dee, and indeed, that is the correct answer.
1:25
The problem with Answer D is that engineer and a manager have Mary in them and the rule for just jointness states that,
1:38
like an object, cannot appear in more than one of the generalisation.
1:47
All right. Key subset entities. Weekend can are entities which depend on the existence of some other entity, and I'll drawn with this double box.
1:53
The particular feature of weekend cities is that they should have both involvement
2:09
in a relationship and a key attributes in order to be a proper formed weak entity.
2:14
So this example here shows the concept of a swipe card that has as its key,
2:23
both an issue number and its involvement with the relationship to person, and hence a swipe card is associated only with a particular person.
2:30
And it's issue number. In this quest question, we think of the concept of how we might relate together, the notion of a subset and of a weak entity.
2:41
So the most popular answer is, D, in fact, the correct answer in this case is B,
3:05
if we look at the notion of a subset, it states that a manager is a subset of the values that appear in person.
3:12
So each manager must be associated to exactly one person and is in effect identified by the instance of persons associated with an.
3:20
Hence, B is the correct representation of this because we have managers being related
3:32
to a person and we're identifying by underlining the one one association,
3:37
the manager by its association with person because a person may or may not be a manager,
3:42
and hence we have not one commonality at the person and note that mobile phone does not take part in the key in D. We almost model the same concept,
3:49
but the instances of manager here will be pairs of a person name and a mobile phone number,
4:01
and therefore the set of values associated with manager is not a subset of the persons
4:08
that we do have the concept that each manager is only associated with one person.
4:15
If we allow relationships to be made between more than two entities,
4:24
we have the notion of a new relationship which corresponds to the notion of a hyper h in graph theory NH, which connect more than two nodes together.
4:29
These are relatively rare in practise, but are useful in certain circumstances, a label to represent certain circumstances.
4:42
And they're similar to the idea of having a weak entity,
4:51
which is associated to any other entities by binary relationships, and there are no key attributes identified.
4:55
Any relationships is always complicated because we're not looking for simple the connexions between two entities, but rather a connexions,
5:05
which are described by multiple clauses where we describe further elaborations of a previous verbal relationship between different entities.
5:14
So here in this example, we have the fact that a person may work in multiple departments,
5:26
which leads itself to the idea that it is a relationship between person departments.
5:31
But we elaborates that a description of the association to say that for each of those works in relationships,
5:37
there's going to be a person who will be assigned a manager and therefore we know naturally lends
5:44
itself to this energy of representation where we have a three way association between the managers,
5:51
the persons and their departments that they are working in.
5:58
Sometimes we want to associate attributes with the relationship that's been made between two entities
6:07
where those values don't naturally sit on either of the entities which are being associated.
6:16
Example here is where we would the start date of when a person joined the department and the end date of when the person department.
6:22
And we've all decided that there is an end in representation between the person
6:30
and departments that persons may work with multiple departments over time.
6:36
And therefore, we have the idea that a person may at one time belong to one department and they're not
6:41
another part time to belong to a second department with different start and end dates.
6:47
And this quiz question, we're trying to associate attributes with the correct entities or relationships.
6:56
That's the most popular answer to this. It was Dee. And indeed, that is the correct answer.
7:08
The important point to note here is that we won't record just a single price for each product,
7:15
and therefore it's natural that price gets associated with the product entity.
7:21
So each product will have a single price. But the quantity of a product is going to be associated with the product in each warehouse,
7:25
i.e. it's going to be associated with the stockholding of the product in the warehouse is incorrect with
7:35
the quantity onto the warehouse entity because then you'd end up with just a single quantity of products,
7:42
all quadrants being associated with a particular warehouse, not the quantity of each product.
7:48
Nested edges occur where you need to associate the instances of a relationship with some of the entities or relationships.
7:59
And this corresponds to the idea of a nested edge in graph theory.
8:09
Example here is where we've identified already that person's work in the department with four works in relationship.
8:14
And then we say that we want to give different instances of that works in a department,
8:21
a role in various projects so that when the person works into parliament, they may be associated with one project or more.
8:27
Notice that in this database,
8:37
it differs from the energy relationship between person department and project in that for a instance of persons working in department to exist.
8:39
If I had an energy relationship, we'd have to be associated with a project.
8:49
Whereas here having a nested relationship, I allow people to work in departments but not be associated with any projects.
8:53
If I have a one one association at one end of a relationship and think that I want
9:06
to put a nested relationship onto the relationship between the two entities,
9:13
in fact, I can easily move that association to be on the entity, which is at the 1:1 end.
9:19
So if I thought that I wanted to associate a persons who are working on in a department with a project,
9:26
but I'm only allowing a person to work in that one department,
9:34
then the association with a project could equally well have well have been made with person directly
9:38
rather than with the works in relationship and in fact is most succinctly stated like that.
9:45
The question is what if the Association of Person with works whom was optional, why not?
9:52
One commonality would the same equivalent hold.
9:58
Well, when previously all sense, the most popular answer was false, and indeed it is false.
10:09
In the left hand air motto for a person to be on a project they must be working in.
10:16
Some department was on the right hand model for a person to be on a project.
10:24
There's no option because the one one called Nazi and they may or may not be working in a department.
10:33
You might think you could fix this to become an equivalence by making the Nazi of person with project not one.
10:39
But then you still have the problem that you could allow a person to be working on the project but not working in a department.
10:46
She still wouldn't have a equivalence. Let me introduce the notion of a mandatory ActionScript, we identify two free facts about it.
10:56
The first was that the Patriots is effectively a pairs of entity instances and value instances drawn from the entity set,
11:12
which is a natural fit off and the values of the type of the attribute plus that is unique and mandatory,
11:22
i.e. each entity has no more than one instance of the attribute and has at least one instance of the attributes.
11:30
Making an attribute optional removes the mandatory property, and if I remove the second property the uniqueness property,
11:39
I end up with a multi valued attribute to a value, an attribute which I can have more than one value associated with a particular entity.
11:48
And if I remove both the optional and the amount, the mantra and unique properties,
11:57
I end up with a multi valued attributes which can have zero or more instances.
12:02
So I have to note these three different cases used in the normal regular expression
12:09
question mark plus and stars a question on Mark Bean's zero one instances.
12:13
Plus means one or more instances and start means zero or more instances.
12:19
So might have a description which says each person may have at least one home phone number
12:25
recorded and may have any number of cars registered as having access to the car park.
12:30
In which case I can have phone numbers recorded as a multi attribute with a plus,
12:35
meaning there must be at least one of them and the cars recorded with an asterisk indicating that can be any number of them recorded.
12:40
So I've introduced a quite a range of different features in my extended air model, as I've mentioned before,
12:50
does that in fact, many different types of a model proposed over time over 100 different types.
12:58
And there are many more different types of modelling construct I could introduce.
13:04
But these are the ones which are most commonly used and the ones most likely to be useful in a particular problem.
13:08
Now, let you to try generating a extended model from this description.
13:15
It's not necessarily the case that all of the modelling constructs that I've introduced will be used in this exercise.
