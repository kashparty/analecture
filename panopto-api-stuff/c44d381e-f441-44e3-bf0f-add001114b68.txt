Title: Careers Session - Interviews
Category: COMP Computing Ad Hoc
Lecturer: Anandha Gopalan
Date: 29/10/2021
But now I'll be recording and hopefully you'll be able to get a copy of this afterwards and there'll be a transcript which is running as well.
0:03
So welcome. My name is Richard Carruthers and the deputy director of the Career Service over the next 55 minutes or so,
0:12
going to be covering the topic of interviews.
0:18
If you do have questions, feel free to add them into the chat at the at the end, there'll be an opportunity for Q&A as well.
0:20
I will switch the recording off for the Q&A part just in case, you know, you may think I have.
0:27
I got a stupid question that I want to ask. I don't want that going on camera.
0:33
I would rather that you ask it.
0:37
I don't think there are stupid questions if you don't know the answer to something, likelihood is that other people don't as well.
0:38
But we'll switch the recording off of that. You will get a copy of the PDF version of the slides that will be uploaded into the meeting.
0:44
So you should be able to download that afterwards. I'm happy to share the content with the Department of Computing.
0:50
So so at the end of the session, we're going to look at the variety of different interview styles that exist.
0:55
They can come in many different formats. We're going to look at what a recruiter is looking for.
1:00
So this could be a hiring manager for an insight week, for an internship, for a graduate level job, for a master's or Ph.D. opportunity.
1:05
So the style of interviews are applicable across the whole range of opportunity sectors.
1:14
We're going to look at what is actually being assessed within the types of questions.
1:19
I've got quite a few slides at the end, which I'm not going to talk over because you'll get the PDF version.
1:23
There's a lot of kind of like this is kind of what they want to hear from this type of questions.
1:29
So you can read through that at your leisure afterwards.
1:34
And we're going to look at how to basically prepare and compose yourself and then deliver the best performance that you can for the activity.
1:37
So interviews are just one part of the recruitment tool that you can be facing.
1:45
If you're going for a big multinational employer, it's likely that you will face pretty much every activity that is mentioned there.
1:52
They'll request your CVS application forms, potentially cover letters. They'll then have a range of interviews.
1:59
Maybe these are early stage and late stage.
2:04
They'll maybe do some form of online tests like psychometrics and situational judgement's, numeracy coding skills,
2:07
maybe get you an assessment centre, delivering a presentation or working with other students.
2:14
So today we're only focussing on one small element of this. The interviews last week we covered CVS and cover letters,
2:18
and next week we're going to cover situational judgements, psychometrics and assessment centres, site interviews.
2:24
They can take many formats. And the world of interviewing has changed dramatically in the last two years.
2:31
You can have phone interviews, you can have video interviews and rare at the moment,
2:38
but an actual in-person interview with someone else, obviously, in the UK with covid case numbers going up,
2:43
industry is still very nervous about bringing students or visitors to their offices because they don't know if you've been following covid,
2:51
secure rules, etc. So the face to face interview live has kind of got on the backburner.
2:58
Not many people have had these in the past couple of years.
3:05
There's been much more move towards initial early stage phone interview where they may just ring you up.
3:09
So you apply for the job and you may just get a phone call. It's probably a private number. You may let it ring off to voicemail.
3:15
So if you have voicemail activated, make sure it's professional voicemail. So you've got through to the voicemail of Richard Carruthers.
3:21
I'm afraid I can't take your call right now. Please leave a message. I'll get back to you.
3:27
Something like that, rather than maybe just the blank otha or Vodafone sort of leave a message.
3:31
They don't know if they've reached the actual candidate and certainly not a jokey sort of like, hello, how are you there?
3:37
I got you. It's my voicemail. Leave a message because the employer's not going to be impressed.
3:43
So make sure it's a professional voicemail that you've got.
3:48
Now, if you do take that call and let's say you're in the JCR and you answer the phone and it's like we're calling from whichever company.
3:51
Do you have a few minutes to conduct a quick interview?
3:58
No, you do not never try and do the interview when you've just been called by the recruiter unexpectedly because you will not do well.
4:02
Make an excuse sort of. I'm sorry, I'm not actually available right now.
4:10
I'm about to go and meet my tutor, but I'm free any time after three o'clock this afternoon or Monday next week,
4:14
and they'll arrange a call-back in that interim time. Go and get your application form.
4:21
Go and read your CV, find a quiet space, gather your thoughts and try go.
4:25
Why did I actually apply to this company? Because they're screening to see.
4:30
Do you know your CV? Do you know why you applied to us in that brief telephone interview so they can cold call you try and reschedule for that.
4:33
If you're telling the small lie and probably the only time you should ever lie in recruitment.
4:42
I've got a meeting with my tutor coming up. Remember what that lie is?
4:48
Because I can guarantee when they ring you back at three o'clock in the afternoon, go.
4:52
How was your meeting with your tutor? Bearlike. What meeting? Oh, yeah, I did have a meeting, didn't I?
4:56
I didn't frantically go and run to.
5:01
Get my CV, so bear that in mind now they may schedule a phone call and say we're going to ring you Thursday at 3:00 p.m. and you say,
5:02
yes, that's fine, obviously be ready for that call. The other thing they can do is they can do video interviews with you.
5:10
So you're going to appear up here on the webcam.
5:16
They're going to potentially put questions on the screen or they're going to have a live video interaction with you,
5:18
a bit like if you were in the room. So there's two different types of video interview.
5:24
The one on the left here is what we'd say is early stage.
5:28
It's a pre-recorded video interviews. So the candidate on the left of the screen here is basically Souda room on their own.
5:33
Questions come up on the screen. They record their answers to them as professionally as they can.
5:39
Then the next question comes up the record, the answer when they've finished,
5:44
that goes off and it sits with the recruiters who basically decide if they want to advance you or Reneke regret you from from the process.
5:47
So I have a look at some top tips for that. It's a little bit alien if you've not done one of these is definitely worth using a practise resource.
5:55
That's coming up. The other one, which is maybe less alien, is basically a video call.
6:01
So a team is called a zoom call, Sky Web, Cisco, whatever it may be,
6:05
there's loads of platforms out there, but you're alive and you're interacting with another human.
6:10
So you get to see someone else at the end of the camera who will probably be nodding along, maybe making some notes as you speak.
6:14
Maybe there'll be a couple of people there. You get feedback from there because you can see people's facial expressions.
6:19
You can see if they're confused. You can see if they're sort of nodding and they're like, oh, yeah, this is good.
6:25
When it's just you recording your own answers, it's alien.
6:30
You don't know how well you're doing because it is just you and your your face essentially.
6:33
So they can be the hard ones to tackle.
6:38
And we did a survey last year of imperial students and it was about eighty percent of imperial students said they hated this experience.
6:40
So we have invested in a platform called Shortlist Me. You've got the link on the screen here.
6:48
You can also exit from our interviews webpage. And when I give you the slide deck, you can click straight through.
6:53
That is me in my dining room trying to answer one of AstraZeneca questions.
6:59
So there are mock interviews that are in there. You'll see the question has basically come up on the screen here.
7:04
When it came up, there was also a twenty second countdown timer.
7:12
So you have twenty seconds to read this and to think what your answer might be.
7:15
Then the video recording starts and this little timer was up here at two minutes and it counts all the way down to zero and then it cuts off.
7:19
It is exactly what your real interviews will look like, but with short list me after the video has recorded, it then plays it back to you.
7:28
And in this box over here, the rubric of what the recruiter was looking for comes up so you can self assess,
7:39
did I do what the recruiter was looking for? So you judge your own answer and decide if if you were doing well or not so well,
7:46
then you can move on to the next question, or you could have a go at rerecording.
7:54
And there's a whole databank of questions in there and we're building more as we go through.
7:57
Now, when you're on camera doing these, whether it is an in-person or a pre-record like this, you'll need to look good on camera.
8:02
I wouldn't say I'm looking my best there, but you'll notice that my background is relatively clear.
8:09
Is the painting or Sarah's paintings behind me? I'm looking sort of professional.
8:14
I look as though I am actually engaged. I'm kind of looking at the camera, which is up there.
8:19
Students have said that they hate these are not just students, graduates. Many applicants say that they hate these.
8:25
The one thing which I can say is you're going to face them, particularly with big companies.
8:30
And actually, let's see, a positive thing here is this question appears and gives you twenty seconds to think.
8:34
And in a real interview, you don't get twenty seconds. Think when it's a live interaction, you haven't got that luxury of planning time.
8:40
You can also second guess the types of questions that may come up.
8:48
So there'll be things like tell me about yourself, why have you applied for this job? And probably something about key skill that you may need.
8:51
So you could have some Post-it notes that have what? The things I want to tell about myself.
8:57
You could have them on the desks when the question comes up, you could be prepared for it.
9:02
Go. Yep. And you could take that Post-it note, maybe stick it just behind the webcam.
9:05
So now you can look at that as a reminder, but it's also going to keep your vision up where the camera is.
9:10
So a few little hints and tips. Some will allow you to rerecord.
9:16
Some won't. Some will say it's one strike, one one live take, and that's it.
9:20
Others will say you can have another go if you feel that you messed up.
9:25
Now, looking good on camera, some Assange's college photographer, an image library manager right at the beginning of covid,
9:29
created a blog about lighting, about thinking about how you're going to be presenting yourself on camera.
9:35
I must say that today I've probably not followed any of those rules because I've got a window behind there.
9:40
My office is quite bright out there, so I might occasionally appear a bit silhouetting.
9:45
It's definitely worth having a look at Thomas's blog post and just sort of going,
9:49
how do you look as best you can on a video call thinking about what's behind you, the lighting, the set up that you've got?
9:53
Now, you may also have heard stories, potentially horror stories around A.I., artificial intelligence being used in these video interviews.
10:02
And the answer, I'm afraid to tell you, is, yes, those horror stories are true.
10:12
A.I. is being employed by a lot of the providers like HireVue Shortlist Me.
10:16
The commercial end is called Short List. That's what companies buy in.
10:22
You will see some A.I. is working in short list me.
10:27
It will show you your speed of delivery and the number of hesitation,
10:31
words or tweaks of a talking too fast or too slow and hesitations which come mean.
10:34
But I is also being used to analyse things like pupil dilation, eye movement, mouth movement, things like this.
10:40
It is looking at a lot of psychology to go kind of like what I would do if people are maybe lying or making things up as the people dilate or not.
10:51
Now, yes, it is being used. The good news, however, is companies aren't trusting it yet.
11:01
So I sort of going, wow, I think this person might have been not maybe telling the whole truth when they gave their answer.
11:08
But the recruiters are not acknowledging that information because it's not good enough yet.
11:15
People like you will end up working for companies like Hillview, I'm sure, in the future and making this thing better.
11:20
But companies are generally they've got it switched on,
11:28
but they're looking at their their results of what they believe against what the A.I. is doing.
11:31
And it is getting better as time goes on.
11:35
But it's probably still a couple of years off before the robots decide whether your answer was any good human is still involved.
11:38
So hopefully that calms your nerves a little bit about the overuse of technology.
11:44
It's been switched on, but it's disconnected from making a judgement on you.
11:48
Is what we're hearing now. The other type of interview that you may get on these sort of digital type ones looks a bit like this.
11:52
So particularly as a computing department, Department of Computing student, you may face a coding test.
11:59
So we've got to touch on these a little next week in the assessment centre area.
12:04
But it may look a little bit like like this. Oh, yeah.
12:09
I'll post a link for that blog at the end. I'll make sure that goes into the chat.
12:13
I'll give you the direct link for it. But here on the on the screen, you can hopefully go.
12:16
There's the coding assignment you've been sent is this treasure.
12:21
So you're given some instructions here and you basically need to write your code to fix this problem.
12:24
Meanwhile, this is you appearing on the screen.
12:28
So you're being filmed as you do this. And this little person here, this is the recruiter watching you, probably talking to you.
12:32
And there's a chat window that they can use as well.
12:39
So whilst you're writing your code, they're asking you questions about why you're doing that or what way would you look to tackle this?
12:41
And there's some chat function that could be used as well. So they're witnessing you trying to actually resolve a technical problem and they're
12:49
having a discussion with you about why you are writing the code in that particular way.
12:57
Is there something that you could clean up in the code? What's your thought process for this?
13:01
It's very much a sort of an assessment centre, technical interview style question which can be going on.
13:05
So it's quite a nice screen grab there of one of these scenarios. May look like some of you may have encountered them.
13:11
And then the other interview, the big panel face to face this obviously a bit of a screen shot sort of stock image of theirs for intimidating people,
13:16
asking the candidate lots of questions about themselves and why they should get the job.
13:28
Now, these generally aren't taking place much at the moment due to covid, probably maybe next spring, summer time, they'll start up again.
13:32
But companies as opposed to in person moved it all online. But I think it's useful just to see this, because a couple of things to bear in mind.
13:38
Here is your recruitment panel.
13:44
These people over here, they've got a laptop, they've got some documents from these are your sleeves, this is your application form.
13:47
They are grilling you on the stuff that you have sent them.
13:54
So you as the candidate here, should probably have your CV and your document in front of you.
13:57
When we were definitely doing face to face interviews, I'll tell students to get hold of something like this,
14:02
you know, like a little folder so you could take your CV in there.
14:06
As you walk into the room, you have something to hold.
14:10
Your other hand can shake hands with people now with sort of elbow bump with people, but it gives you something to hold.
14:12
You present yourself professionally by walking into the room.
14:18
Now online, you obviously won't be able to show people, look how professional presented myself that I've brought my folder.
14:21
But you could certainly have a printout of your CV in front of you and your cover letter,
14:26
because if this panel were to ask you and I have asked this question myself when I've done recruitment in the past,
14:31
you've got a sort of a really interesting project, second project here on your CV.
14:36
Could you talk me through that? And it is very clear if the candidate has any knowledge of their CV, has their CV in front of the guy.
14:41
Sorry, the second project, do you mean. Oh, is this my my Pinto's project like.
14:48
Yes, that's the one. So have your documents in front of you because your recruiter may try and test
14:52
your professionalism and your work readiness by essentially going up your CV.
14:58
Please explain it to me or the top of page two. What do you mean by this activity?
15:02
Talk me through. How did that happen? And if you don't know, you'll see that it's not there in front of you.
15:07
You're not going to do particularly well.
15:11
So have all of these documents to hand say the best way to approach an interview, treat it as best you can as a conversation, not an interrogation.
15:13
And it will feel as though you're being interrogated,
15:22
because I got to fire a lot of questions at you and you need to give them good answers so it feels like you're in this sort of interrogator's chair.
15:24
But if you can try and position in your mindset, yes, they are offering me an opportunity that I very much want.
15:32
So they hold the power at the moment. But I am also making a judgement about whether I want to work for them.
15:38
Do they seem like the team that I would like to be part of and that.
15:46
Certainly can help level out the power dynamics from them having all the power to,
15:50
if you can try and position yourself with, but actually I want to find out if I really want to work for them.
15:54
Do I want this person to be my line manager for the summer or forever my graduate scheme so that I can help with the sort of the nerves,
15:59
if you kind of like? Okay, they're assessing me, but I am also assessing them for a fit.
16:08
And you may get a job offer at the end of it and you do not have to accept it.
16:13
I've rejected two offers after interview. One of them was with a company a few years ago in the city and was offered the job role.
16:17
And I just got an awful vibe from the organisation and the people that I met and the whole process that I went through.
16:24
And I basically knew about halfway into the interview that I was I do not want
16:31
to work for these people by continued the interview to the end and then left.
16:35
And about an hour later they rang. And they would like we'd like to offer you the opportunity.
16:40
And I politely rejected and said, you know, actually thank you very much for the opportunity.
16:44
But at this moment in time, having gone through the process, I'm just not sure it's quite the right move for me.
16:49
But I wish you all the best with your search. And maybe at some point in the future, our paths might might cross again.
16:55
So you can politely and respectfully reject the opportunity as such a good feeling when you actually say no to your interviewer if you go there.
17:01
Actually, this is not for me. So it can help with the power dynamic if you can try to get that in your mindset,
17:09
trying to turn this into actually I want to find some stuff out rather than just that.
17:15
Now, the top skills for twenty, twenty five that have come out of various bits of recent research are up on the screen here.
17:19
They typically come into what can be classified as problem solving skills, people skills, self-management skills and the use of tech.
17:25
So you could go read more about this. When you get the PowerPoint slide deck, you can go access the link on here if you wish to find out a bit more.
17:34
But ultimately they can assess whatever they want. And the job description will be a very good start for what they're assessing.
17:42
But behind every question, behind every interview, behind the entire recruitment process, to be honest,
17:48
are these three underlying questions as a hiring manager and I'll give you my own experiences in this.
17:53
I've probably recruited life for graduate schemes.
18:00
I've probably interviewed just over a thousand students for various internships with previous companies here.
18:04
I will be done several hundred mock interviews with students. I've interviewed, experienced hires.
18:12
I've interviewed students. And generally what I'm always looking at is, number one, do I believe that you could do this job?
18:17
So based on your past experience, do you have the skill sets?
18:24
That might be the technical skill sets. It might be the academic skill sets.
18:29
It might be the soft skills like can you work with other people or can you actually manage a project from start to finish?
18:32
So do I believe that based on your experiences, can you tell me stories that make me think, yes, you probably do the job I'm about to offer you?
18:40
So that's question one, question two. And this is usually my bigger question, actually.
18:48
Why do you want to do this? What is your motivation to work for my organisation?
18:53
So I don't just want to know that you work to work as a software developer and that you want to be a user experience.
19:00
I want to know why you want to work in user experience at my company.
19:05
So what is it that we do, like tell me about our projects or products.
19:10
Tell me about the way that we work or the clients that we've worked with.
19:14
So you've got quite a bit of research because otherwise it just comes across as well.
19:17
You're looking for a job and that could be anyone's job. And if that's the case and I hire you.
19:21
I'm going to be investing time and developing you. I'm going to put you on training courses.
19:28
I'm going to pay you a salary. I'm going to pay tax. I'm going to pay towards your pension.
19:32
And if you don't really want to be here, I might do all of that.
19:36
And six months later, you leave and you go work for a company that you really do want to be up.
19:38
And I've basically made a hideous return on investment. So I'm looking for a long term commitment,
19:42
which is why you may sometimes get questions like where do you see yourself in
19:48
three or five years time because they want to see you committed to this company.
19:51
Do you want to progress through the organisation? And also, my third question, trying to assess through the whole process is will you fit?
19:55
Can I picture myself working with you? Are you going to be someone that is easy to get along with?
20:03
That will be easy to manage.
20:09
So what I'm looking at here is your personality and the way you portray yourself on the camera, the way you structure an answer.
20:12
So can you tell me a story that is clear and logical and I can follow it through, or is it a bit chaotic and all over the place?
20:20
And I'm now starting to picture the chaotic person going,
20:27
what if I asked them for an update on their project and I'm going to get a 10 minute ramble through all sorts of different things.
20:30
And I'm not really going to know where their project actually is at the moment.
20:37
So, you know, there's various things that I'm looking at is kind of what are you going to be like to manage what you're going to be like?
20:42
Give the updates and I can assess that on whether you can give nice, clear, structured answers.
20:49
I can go. Yeah, this person could give me a project update. It's easy to follow and easy to understand.
20:54
So I'll show you a few hints and tips on that in a moment. So I've got a rhetorical question for you at this point.
20:59
Just sort of think, what will you do if this happens and email has just come into your inbox for the dream job that you really want and you've
21:04
applied to and you have been invited to a video interview live with the people next Friday afternoon at one o'clock.
21:12
What are you going to do between now that email has just dropped and next Friday at 1pm, where you are planning to attend that interview?
21:20
What are the steps that you going to work through and just thinking through in your head?
21:31
What what will you do if you're in a lecture hall and get people to start shouting out?
21:35
I could get you to do that now, but probably in the interests of time, we will just move to what the answers hopefully could be.
21:40
So they're going to fall into a few areas. The first thing that you will probably want to do, or actually there's a step before the first thing.
21:49
So the first thing you will probably do is go look at your CV, maybe review your skills or go, what did I tell the company?
21:56
What did I put in my cover letter? What actually is this role that I've applied for?
22:03
Who am I? What how am I going to protect myself? So definitely that will be something.
22:08
But I would say even before that is RSVP to that interview invite.
22:12
So respond to civil play. Yes. Thank you for the offer of interview next Friday at 1pm online.
22:18
I look forward to meeting you best wishes, so just acknowledge the invite and thank them for that opportunity.
22:27
They will be ready to interview you if you don't acknowledge.
22:36
But I can guarantee that one of the first questions, if you don't say yes, thank you, I'll be there.
22:39
Question number one. So were you too busy to let us know that you could attend today or something equally as
22:43
awkward that puts you on the back foot and makes a very it's a bad negative impression.
22:49
So thank them for the opportunity, confirm your attendance, check any details back with them.
22:54
Just sort of make sure if you're not sure if your tech's going to work, you know, you could ask them to go.
22:59
Yeah, absolutely. I'm happy to meet at one o'clock next week. I have told you.
23:05
Why would it be possible to check the technology with you beforehand just to make sure that I can connect if you can't do one o'clock
23:09
next week because you're planning to come to my session on online tests and assessments and make an excuse like my money thing,
23:16
I'd say probably skip and go to the interview, to be honest with you.
23:24
But let's say if it's a lecture you can't avoid or an exam that you can't avoid at that time, respond to them and just go.
23:27
Thank you so much for the opportunity. Unfortunately, one PM next Friday clashes with a coursework assignment that I must attend,
23:31
but I would be free before midday or after 4pm or I am available the next week at any time.
23:40
So if you can't make it for a valid reason like something to do with you,
23:47
of course you can't get out of let them know if you can't make it because it was
23:51
a mate's 21st birthday the night before and you think you can have a hangover. Not a good reason.
23:55
And I have had a candidate tell me that I was like, well, you either want this job or you don't.
23:59
So it has to be a valid excuse as to why you may want to reschedule nine times out of ten.
24:04
They'll try their best to reschedule because they're actually interested in you.
24:09
But, you know, they may not there may be some companies that go with can't make it.
24:12
That makes our job easier. We'll pick someone else. So that will be first, then your skills audit, then the job advert.
24:17
Figure out what you've applied for now, often when you apply for a job.
24:24
The advertisement is online when the deadline passes, that disappears,
24:27
so please take screenshots or download when you're applying, have a good filesystem.
24:32
This is the CV that I use. This is the cover letter.
24:37
This is the actual advertisement I've applied for or the person specification store it all in one place.
24:40
So if you get these invites, you can go and look at everything you provided and you can review that job spec.
24:45
You could start thinking what the questions they might ask me, what software do they want me to know,
24:50
what the skills that they put in that job advertisement that they may quiz me on to try to find out if I can do the job,
24:54
make sure, you know, the organisations to start reading their website is a good place to go to.
25:02
But check them out in the news, check them out on social media, like their Twitter accounts, their Instagram stuff they published on LinkedIn.
25:07
If you were given the names of your interviewers, Google them, search them in LinkedIn, see if you can find out who are these people, what do they do?
25:13
How long have they been at the company?
25:21
You could then start figuring out, actually, maybe I've got some questions to ask of them to turn it into a conversation,
25:23
because interviews will quite often have a time at the end for you to ask things.
25:29
So if you were to say yes, actually person X, I, I saw on your LinkedIn profile that you used to be involved in X,
25:34
Y and Z projects and now you do this area stuff.
25:42
Is that a similar project area that I'll be involved in to begin with?
25:46
What's the sort of so you can look informed and super keen and really motivated.
25:49
So can you do the job? Will you do the job? You did a bit of research. So check out what's going on with the company and then the practical details.
25:53
So I do have RSVP up there. Thank them. Say yes, check the logistics.
26:01
Are you free? Do you have a quiet room? Can you tell your classmates or your whole mates or your housemates that you are interviewing?
26:06
Please do not disturb if you need a quiet room to do an interview.
26:12
In video wise, I'm putting out here, I'm looking at our reception desk, speak to them.
26:15
We've got rooms that you can book that are plugged into the Wi-Fi, that have webcams and audio equipment,
26:20
etc. So we have space if you need to use it during during the weekdays, think about what clothes you're going to wear.
26:25
Do you need to get a haircut? I certainly do. I probably should have had a shave.
26:32
Just thinking about how you're going to present yourself.
26:36
You don't need to wear a full suit and tie for these sorts of video type things, but you do need to look professional.
26:41
So open collared shirt or shirt with sort of jumper, polo shirt, something like that, which just gives a professional sort of look to yourself.
26:46
Then when you're doing your research on a company, a good hint or tip to look into is to basically do a SWOT analysis on the organisation.
26:57
So what are the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities, the threats? Because this could help you with any commercial questions that come up.
27:04
It could help you with questions that have been asked of graduates applying for jobs.
27:11
If you were the CEO of this company and you ran the place, what would keep you up at night?
27:16
What are you concerned about? What are the challenges that our company is facing?
27:22
And you're going I'm applying for graduate software development job. Why am I getting asked that?
27:26
They're checking if you know what the industry as a whole and the company as a whole does.
27:32
And that's where a SWOT analysis can be super useful.
27:36
It can also help you identify where some of the things that you could contribute to the company could be in those opportunity areas.
27:38
Here are some growth areas. The business this is what I could bring to you as a company.
27:45
So a good place to to get some background information on the multinationals is reading the news,
27:49
reading around sort of the economic position of what's going on there and using this fantastic resource that's paid for by the college.
27:56
You all have free access to it. Market line advantage. The weblink is up there on the page.
28:03
You can search it under the library. In the business sector, there's a whole range of free access reports you can get.
28:08
But market line advantage is a fantastic resource for big multinationals.
28:14
If you're going to go and work IBM or Google or Facebook or Cisco or Palantir,
28:18
there are reports on them which have here's some contract news that they've been involved in.
28:25
Here's some deals, mergers, acquisitions, financial statements, and here's a SWOT analysis about this company.
28:29
So it's a kind of a very much a cheat sheet to go and have a look at to help him maybe with your cover letters as well or your applications,
28:36
but certainly can help before you go to an interview to have a quick skim through and
28:44
not expecting you to read the whole report and become an absolute business insider.
28:48
But I would expect you to have some knowledge about the company before you go to the interview with them,
28:52
because they may ask you direct questions like, well, you've applied to us, but, you know, who are our competitors?
28:57
And if you're sat there going, I've got absolutely no idea.
29:02
I've been interviewed by IBM to be a software development or work in a creative at the Herzlinger facilities.
29:05
And I don't know who their competitors are. Market line advantage will tell you that their main competitor is Accenture and Accenture, vice versa.
29:11
It's IBM. They're going to lose business. They're going to lose it, salespeople, people.
29:20
So you can have that background and it can make some of these commercial questions so much.
29:22
Easier to address as an applicant, other places to look beforehand would be to check out the corporate values.
29:26
So this is Splunk, who are a data analytics machine learning data science organisation and consultancy.
29:35
And they have values. All companies have values. They'll be on there about US pages.
29:45
You can see here, Sprunt dot com and us about US values, usually where you're going to find them,
29:49
the corporate values stuff which is drilled and instilled into the people that work there.
29:56
Here at Imperial, we have our imperial expectations of which we have seven.
30:00
I've got them up there on my wall. It's things like champion, a positive approach to change, communicate regularly, efficiently across teams.
30:06
Consider the thoughts and expectations of others are quite wordy.
30:13
Other companies have things like Splunk, innovate, innovative, passionate, disruptive, open, fun with a little description.
30:16
And this is the type of person they're looking for, the fit to the organisation.
30:24
Are you an innovative person? They're going to ask you maybe questions around when did you challenge the status quo?
30:28
When did you come up with something new? They're going to look at your passion for the subject.
30:34
They're going to look at whether you're disruptive. It's a bit like the innovative. Have you changed things?
30:39
Did you find ways to do different things open? Are you honest where you put your hand up?
30:43
When I made a mistake, that was me. I get that. Sorry, but I've learnt and fun looking.
30:47
They're really at personality. Like, do you have some sort of personality that you can bring out in the interview so values can show you a lot of
30:53
what the company is looking for and maybe what they may be questioning you on during the recruiting process.
31:01
And then we get to the actual interview itself and how we communicate. So we've got the three monkeys.
31:06
They're the see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil communication.
31:11
How we communicate as humans is it's about seven percent of what we pick up from people is the actual words.
31:16
The the actual language that we use account for about seven percent of what we're picking up from people.
31:26
About thirty percent is the phraseology, the way that what they said, how that is, how that is listened to.
31:33
So the actual words, words mean things. But then there's the way that that is presented, about thirty percent of how a human is basically.
31:40
So if there's a tone of sarcasm, we can basically pick up on that.
31:47
If something someone's quite passionate, excited about what they're saying. We're picking up on that passion from him.
31:53
And then the big chunk, fifty percent or thereabouts is body language and facial expression.
31:58
And as humans, we are very, very emotive an expression.
32:05
It faces move, which is why we're on camera.
32:08
It's sort of like sitting there and and you may use your hands a little bit.
32:13
You may use the shoulders. You may have sort of a pen that you sort of hold.
32:16
Just don't click the pen. That's super annoying, actually. Then takes the microphone.
32:20
You probably pick it up. But looking at the camera, engaging with the people, you're speaking to the hands sort of movements,
32:24
not crazy hand movements all out here because I like do I want to work with this person? Absolutely no way.
32:31
But do I want to work with the person who can actually seems as though they are engaged and can actually focus on
32:35
on the people they're speaking to and can look at the cameras and can deal with that or physically in a room?
32:41
Are they going to sit and do their interview and talk to the keyboard or talk to the desk and not actually engage with their audience, which is there?
32:46
Or or are they actually going to look at the people they're speaking with and be engaged hopefully with the organisations,
32:53
try and focus on where a webcam is or at least on screen and don't spend too long looking down because they might think you're reading from notes.
32:59
They may think you're disinterested. Do they want to work with you?
33:06
Probably not. But if you look at them and you engage them, yes, maybe they do.
33:09
So your body language is really, really important in interviews. So smile, you're going to be super nervous.
33:15
But try and crack a smile when you go in the room. Handshakes when we're in the room, obviously not in covid-19.
33:20
It's all elbows and fist bumps and things. Good eye contact, maintain eye contact in the room, maintaining eye contact with the camera.
33:26
At least look at the screen, not keyboard sits up reasonably straight.
33:33
And if you've got a chair like mine where I could spin it, try not to be doing this,
33:36
because if I was doing the interview and I'm doing this, it's kind of off putting for the interviewers.
33:40
And you look as though you may be quite nervous and I'm starting to lose a bit of light.
33:44
Do I actually want to work with you?
33:48
So Citris be straight if you're in the room with them, sort of don't sort of sit with your arms folded because you look a bit disinterested,
33:50
don't sit too far back that you look as though you're really bored by what's going on.
33:57
It's kind of straight up being interesting, being engaged, speak clearly and not too fast.
34:00
I speak fast, I speak fast and I present.
34:05
I try to be aware of that and slow it down at times.
34:09
I certainly do speak fast in interviews and I just need to be aware of that and maybe bring it down.
34:13
If you are like a Gatling gun, a machine gun firing a thousand words a minute,
34:19
your recruiter and talking about how excited you are to be on this project wasn't a.
34:23
Amazing and all the wonderful things that you did, they are sat there going,
34:26
I've got no idea what you have just said, so deliver it at a pace which is followable.
34:29
That's probably a word I've made up that they can follow. And nice and clear, nice and concise and just be slightly aware of the speed.
34:37
Modulate your voice. If you're saying you were interested in the project you did in year two,
34:45
we were going to sit there and say I was really interested in a project that I did in year two.
34:48
It was a fascinating role for me to be involved. And I was responsible for checking the the text after we'd done the coding and the blah, blah, blah.
34:53
Or are you going to say I was actually I was really interested in this. This, this project that we did is quite fascinating.
35:01
The opportunity I was responsible for checking the script that we've written and just that bit of modulation makes you sound much more interesting,
35:06
much more passionate. Do they want to work with you? Do they like you?
35:13
They're starting to build that and develop, particularly if it's a company that like Splunk, which that's fun.
35:16
They're looking for sort of relatively animated people and dress appropriately.
35:21
Key thing look relatively smart if you're propped up in bed and it looks like you've just woken up,
35:26
you're maybe just wearing a T-shirt that has some sort of last night's dinner spilt on it.
35:33
I don't want to hire you. I don't want to work with you. But if you put a bit of effort in and you're looking like a reasonable, normal human.
35:39
Yes, I want to I want to work with you. So think about the dress code that you want to go for.
35:46
So tax questions are going to face. And I'm going to give you a list of some of the questions and what's behind it.
35:52
You're going to get generic questions. So sort of opener's. Tell me about yourself.
35:58
We'll look at that in a moment.
36:03
You may have some strength based questioning which goes on, which could be related to things like your personality, MBT, Iowa starter or a finisher.
36:04
Do you see big picture or small details? So any of you which have been going through the sort of the training courses that we've been
36:12
delivering on within the academic teaching professional skills might have encountered the MBT stuff.
36:19
If you haven't, it may be coming up. We do some centrally, but it could be looking at your strengths.
36:25
What do you consider your core skills and can you back it up with evidence? So don't just say so if I or my organisation is a strength.
36:29
OK, prove it. I need the proof, so a strength will be, I think, my my organisation during my time at university,
36:38
I often take a leadership role within group projects are very good at basically
36:44
planning the window of time that we have a six week window for a project.
36:49
I can break that, Nancy, back it up with evidence. Don't just say organisation.
36:53
It's too blunt. They need the evidence. You may get situational or competency based.
36:58
This will be things like tell me about a time when you worked with other people and what did you do to deliver a successful outcome.
37:02
So I want a story now about when have you done something? So I'm asking you directly, give me evidence.
37:10
I'm going to give you a framework you can use for that behavioural questions.
37:15
They're a bit like the strength based, but they'll be looking at the type of sort of what we do in these scenarios.
37:19
So this has happened in the workplace. What are you going to do about it, Specialist?
37:25
And those could be technical coding questions, specialist academic knowledge.
37:30
It could be things around you. How important is data privacy and the GDP within the world of finance?
37:35
Answer is going to be incredibly important.
37:44
You've probably covered security or ethics within some of your course content, or you can read around it and go,
37:47
yeah, there's certain rules of what can and can't be done with people's data.
37:53
So some specialist, some technical stuff could come up and some unusual ones.
37:56
Now, these went a bit out of fashion. They were around a lot in the sort of like the 2008, 2009, 2010.
38:01
Then they went out of fashion and now they've sort of come back in because recruiters are interviewing a lot of people and they quite often get bored.
38:09
And they put a question in just sort of see how he may respond.
38:17
And they may be peculiar questions, such as if you were a Microsoft Office programme, what programme would you be and why?
38:20
I said I got out. We answer that.
38:30
And the answer that you're really looking for there is they're just seeing maybe it's Splunk looking at maybe how fun or creative you could be.
38:33
So you might go, well, actually, I've put myself down as maybe I'm I'm either Excel or maybe I'm Visio.
38:40
I'm quite an organised person. So I like the order which Excel gives you and sort of you get finite calculations, you can get answers.
38:46
So I'm probably that. Or you may go in with I'm Visio because I like swim lanes.
38:55
I like to plan things out. I'm very organised. I like don't see whose responsibilities, deadlines.
39:00
And so maybe I'm Visio or I'm a creative platform.
39:05
So I like word words, not very creative, but these unusual ones have sort of come in and they can quite often be follow a preceding question,
39:10
which is tell me about a time when you've handled pressure. And then you give your nice structured answer about pressure, circumstance, brilliant.
39:18
OK, well, what platform are, you know. Oh, OK. Now it is a pressurised situation.
39:26
What platform am I there? Can actually see how you do perform. But they went our favour, but they are sneaking in again,
39:30
a few recruiters trying to answer these because they're looking at creativity, but also they get quite bored.
39:35
So they like to put a fun question, fun question in for you there.
39:41
So let's look then at generic question, a typical one that will start your interview.
39:46
This is often the beginning of a video pre-record.
39:50
And I would place a bet that 99 percent of interviews start with the question.
39:54
Tell me about yourself or talk me through your CV. Now, what they're looking for here is an answer in roughly two minutes.
39:58
So a minute and a half, two minutes to tell them who you are and draw out relevant things from your degree.
40:05
So I read you need to get a haircut. So relevant things from your degree, from your CV, from your life story.
40:12
What we want to do is we want to hear about you. So firstly, introduce yourself.
40:18
If I was asked this question, interview would be like, OK, well, my name's Richie Carruthers.
40:22
I'm currently the deputy director of the career service at Imperial College London. So you'll be answering with I'm picking on a name there.
40:26
My name's Ben. I'm a second year Menge computing student at Imperial College.
40:32
So set the scene. Who are you then? Talk a bit about your background. What brought you to Imperia?
40:38
What made you choose computing? What was the thought process that went on during your A-levels that got you to this point in time?
40:43
Have you travelled? Are you an international student? How has that been? What challenges have you encountered?
40:50
And then start telling me about your actual experiences. So what have you done in your degree programme?
40:55
What are you learning that is relevant to me as your employer? So you might want to tell me that you're learning about databases,
41:00
that you're learning about cybersecurity or doing user experience and app development.
41:06
You've done various group projects. Your most recent one was the dot, dot, dot, where you're responsible for this and you delivered a presentation.
41:09
Tell me about your sideline interests. Have you taken part in a hackathon? Are you a treasurer for a society?
41:17
Do you play hockey for the university? Are you passionate about musical theatre?
41:23
Have you done teaching? Give me some details that are on your CV.
41:27
Bring that CV to life and talk me through. This is a question that you can 100% prepare for.
41:31
You can practise your answer. You can record and film your answer.
41:38
You can listen back to it and go, have I got about a minute and a half to two minutes,
41:41
which tells people who I am but brings in the decision reasons and the passion that I have and then draw it to an end with.
41:46
And I'm applying for the position of software developer IBM because it's got that creative aspect.
41:55
I get to work within a team and it looks like a great place to start my career or
42:00
to do my internship or my placement so you can bring your answer to a close by,
42:06
then selling yourself in a sentence or two to them. So every single one of you should be able to go away and practise recording and listening.
42:11
Back to your answers on Tell Me About Yourself Short. Let me have this question in there so you can do this on a mobile phone.
42:18
You can log into the shortlist, a platform, and then watch your answer back.
42:24
And honestly, I 100 percent believe people when they go, it is really cringeworthy and awful to listen to yourself back.
42:28
I hate it. I will probably not watch this recording because I hate the sound of my own voice.
42:36
I hate the way that I look on camera. I hate the way that I yeah, it's awful, but it's a safe space.
42:41
You're the only one that's going to see it unless you suddenly share it with everyone on
42:47
WhatsApp and you could delete that video once it is done and is better that you practise it,
42:51
then roll up to a live interview and suddenly don't know what you're talking about.
42:55
So you can definitely do this then. Competency questions.
43:00
This is the other framework you have was mentioned in the animation. I think it popped up before in the sort of practising stuff.
43:04
Star answers. These are your framework to structure anything.
43:10
We are trying to tell a story. Tell me about a time when dot, dot, dot. So you want to explain the situation, the task.
43:16
This is sometimes known as the context. So it becomes the car framework rather than the star, but break things into the situation.
43:22
So when did you do something, set the scene, when did it take place?
43:29
Who was involved, how long did you have and what was the actual task?
43:33
What were you trying to accomplish? And this is part of your answer of roughly two minutes of talking.
43:38
This is accounting for about twenty percent of that time. And the same thing applies.
43:44
If you were writing answers on application form tellers when you have done this right,
43:49
there was a time in second year when we had to do a six week project with five other people and
43:54
it was to write a bit of code for a particular task and then deliver a ten minute presentation.
44:00
So we've got all the details and the numbers at the front.
44:06
Then the real interesting bit for the recruiter is, but what do you the person I'm interviewing, what did you do?
44:10
So talk as much as you can about I I was responsive.
44:17
Before I took charge of this bit, my role was to do da da da da da, try to avoid talking too much about we we decided that we do this.
44:22
We collectively did this because I was an interviewer. I'm sat there going, this is lovely, this is brilliant.
44:33
But it was a team of six of you and I've got absolutely no idea what you did.
44:38
And you're the person I'm trying to hire. And if I don't know what you did, I can't score you high.
44:43
The team did a wonderful job. I don't know what your role was, so you're not going to get very good point.
44:49
So you have to talk about yourself in the setting now if it's a team task.
44:55
Obviously, there will be mention of other people, but do make sure you mention what your role was within that.
44:59
And then at the end, our final percentage there is the results.
45:05
So you told us at the beginning what you were setting out to do. Did you achieve that?
45:10
So it was to deliver a 10 minute presentation we delivered on our presentation and we were awarded 72 percent.
45:14
We were very happy with our result. So try and bring it to an end with an actual conclusion.
45:20
But I would actually say that there is a secondary are to this because as an interviewer,
45:25
I'm very, very interested about your continued professional development. Have you learnt from the experience and what was it?
45:29
So we worked as a team project. We delivered the presentation and we got 72 percent and it went really well.
45:36
But the night before was quite stressful.
45:42
We we stayed up till about 4:00 in the morning finishing our slide deck and it was quite late and rushed at the end.
45:45
But I have realised that the final edit can take a lot longer than we thought.
45:53
So you've learnt from an experience that can get you a little bonus points.
45:57
So I've got an example here on the screen. So this would be if you were doing it as a written on an application form,
46:01
say within 150 words is often the word count that can account for sort of like a minute, minute and a half worth of speaking.
46:07
But here we have that situation task. So nominated to lead a team of five a group project in the second year.
46:12
No worries. There is a recording, it should appear, in the charts. I see someone's got a lecture.
46:18
They need to jump into that. We starting soon. But it is your sort of your your situation and your task.
46:23
All the details, the numbers are in there. Then we've got that bit where you're talking about what you did.
46:28
So identifying the strengths of people before going into lab,
46:33
ensure that we've got a project plan and then drawing it to that conclusion, that result coming in there at the end.
46:37
So we completed on time and the experience taught me about clear communication to meet project deadlines.
46:43
Fantastic. We have a nice, clear story. So I'm assessing do I want to work with you?
46:48
There's now an easy to follow process. Your answers make sense.
46:52
So as well as you've told me, you've got the skills to do it. I also now also think you'll fit that question.
46:58
One and three have been assessed through here.
47:04
So before an interview, I have a bit of confidence in yourself that you've been invited to an interview stage,
47:07
which means they like what you have given them so far. So now is your time to really sort of impress.
47:12
So have a glass of water to. So when your throat goes dry, you can you've got some liquid, relax, do a bit of deep breathing.
47:16
What techniques work for you just sort of go. Right. I'm going into the interview. Can a few minutes.
47:26
Cool, calm, collected. I've got some notes in front of me. I've got my water. The techs going to work.
47:31
I'm good to go. Don't rush to answer the questions.
47:35
So if it's a pre-record, you've got a twenty second timer to think if it's live and they ask you a question and you go,
47:39
oh, I've got no idea what this just asked. Take a moment. Think you know, that's actually a really good question.
47:44
I've got a couple of answers or examples I could give.
47:48
So I think, yes, in my second year and that little sip of water, if they can see that I'm so if I've got a couple of months,
47:58
I see a moment to think you can't speak when you've got water in your mouth.
48:06
That's a visual cue to your recruiter that you have a little think. And yet, in my second year, you've bought yourself about 10 seconds,
48:10
frantically thinking or looking at your sheets of paper going, I know I've got an answer somewhere.
48:18
Yeah, I've got a couple of examples I'm going to talk about this time in year two.
48:23
And then we start our star answer. Practise that star answer.
48:26
You can use it for lots of different scenarios like problem solving, handling conflict, meeting deadlines.
48:29
When things go wrong, you can you probably got answers for all the typical recruitment questions that come up clear and concise frameworks.
48:34
So tell us about yourself. Star answers. Breathe during the interview and if you better a question up, it's one question of probably seven or eight.
48:43
I have hired students, graduates that have messed up an interview because it was one question, not the end, not the end of the world.
48:52
My best example was this probably going back about eight or so,
49:03
maybe nine years now in interviewing for a project management grant scheme, lady came up for her interview.
49:06
She was a final year student. She had a handbag on her shoulder and she came to shake hands.
49:15
The handbag slid off the shoulder and knocked over a two litre jug of water over my laptop and my crotch and over my colleague.
49:21
She was mortified. You could see the bright redness. The tears were about to happen.
49:28
She basically tried to run out the room. I'm so, so sorry.
49:32
And left was I don't know. And we got the receptionist to stop her.
49:35
It was like, right, get her to the bathroom, get her to sort herself out, give a ten, fifteen minutes.
49:37
We're going to dry up in here. We're interviewing you. We're bringing you into this interview, setting that interview went ahead.
49:42
She got the job offer because she composed herself so much, she just had literally the worst start to an interview probably ever.
49:47
And she held it together. She gave really good answers. She's the person I wanted on the team.
49:54
Now, I am not suggesting to throw water at your interview, but disasters can happen and you can still get the job.
49:59
So be aware of of that and keep it in perspective complete in the interview, think of any questions you may want to ask of them.
50:05
You've only got a couple of minutes to ask them. So it's things like, you know, what type of project might be involved in,
50:12
if that's not clear, or something like maybe what happens next in the interview process.
50:17
Like, I am very keen, is there is another stage, maybe something along those lines.
50:22
If you did some research on the recruiters, now's the time to sort of ask them,
50:26
oh, you seem to have headed up this department and these types of projects. Will I be working directly with you,
50:30
like in the know anything difficult down and then come speak to me or one of my team and go, this happens in an interview.
50:35
I've got no idea what they meant. We can probably pick up for you.
50:40
So reflect on the experience. Always ask them for feedback. If they reject you, just say if it's an interview stage.
50:44
This video interview pre-record, you may not get any feedback, but if it's a face to face interview, most companies will give you feedback.
50:50
So ask for it. They may not volunteer it straight away, but you could, if you'd been rejected, go.
50:57
OK, no worries. Thank you very much. It was a great opportunity. Is it possible to get any feedback on my performance?
51:01
And most companies will offer you something, but keep that door open for opportunities.
51:07
Don't let it slam. You may get rejected. Don't tell them how wrong it is.
51:12
You will get a copy of the slides. I'll pop them in the charts. You should be able to download them afterwards.
51:16
I'll pass them across to the department as well with the recording. Keep the opportunity open.
51:20
Don't tell them what a travesty this is. And they've missed out on an amazing opportunity because you're a great first class
51:25
student and they're they're obviously not deserving of you because they will.
51:31
Certainly not. Hey, I've had it in the past. I had one graduate once.
51:36
You told me how wrong it was that I didn't hire them and that were clearly capurso. I'm sorry.
51:40
You don't know who the other people were. But also, I was going to give him not a job role in my team,
51:44
but a colleague of mine had a pretty much identical role in H.R. said that we could have offered that.
51:50
I let that individual know that I was saying no, but I was going to pass it across to a colleague of mine who she was going to take them.
51:55
But actually, I'm going to go have a chat with them and suggest that we reneke that offer altogether.
52:01
But I want to make sure they knew that they had done wrong. So please don't be in that position.
52:05
Final sort of sites for me, then prepare in advance. Know yourself, the organisation, go through that slide on sort of planning for your future.
52:11
Make sure you read your CV, listen to the questions and if you don't understand what they've asked, ask them for help.
52:19
If you're entitled to additional time in exams,
52:25
then raise this with your interviewers beforehand because they may actually some companies are really, really good at this.
52:29
Might even send you the questions in advance.
52:34
They'll want proof that you have specific learning differences or that you're registered with the Disability Advisory Service.
52:37
But a lot of companies will make reasonable adjustments in the workplace and they'll want to discuss that with you and say, how is this going to work?
52:43
Would it be should we text the the the questions to you?
52:49
Would you like to see a copy of the questions in advance? We can give you more thinking time.
52:52
So An even if that doesn't apply to you and you're not entitled to extra time, if you don't understand the question, just say I'm really sorry.
52:56
I don't quite understand what you've asked. Could you rephrase the question? They would they will try their best to to get that from me and practise.
53:02
We run a mock interview sessions we run into. Workshops with other students where you can practise your interviews and give each other feedback,
53:10
you can book directly with with our team if you have interviews coming up.
53:17
So the slides, which I am literally going to skim over, are these you get the PowerPoint decks.
53:21
So it's basically telling you what we're looking for in the types of questions.
53:25
So you've got a few sort of slides in a row. So list your work experiences and responsibilities, detail your suitability for the position.
53:30
What we're actually looking for. Give an example of when you handle competing deadlines.
53:38
Give an example of how you have research to analyse complex information. What activities come naturally to you?
53:42
How do you stay motivated? What do we mean by these types of questions here?
53:47
And then finally, with covid-19 being around, people are asking questions related to this.
53:52
What did you learn about yourself? What did you do during covid-19?
53:58
And if it is, I watched a lot of Netflix. I completed Netflix.
54:03
Not the best answer, but if it's like, well, actually it was a struggle to find opportunities.
54:07
So I did a bit of online learning. I self-taught Python or I learn a new language or I did an online course.
54:12
I've done some online internships, I did a bit of volunteering, whatever.
54:20
It may be brilliant. As long as it's not just I played Xbox and watch Netflix, OK, we probably could have done something a little more productive.
54:23
So if you did just watch Netflix and play Xbox, now's the time to maybe find an online course and then say you did that in covid.
54:35
Maybe that's the second point where you could lie a little bit in recruitment,
54:43
but try and make it look as though you did something to personally develop yourself. So further support from us.
54:47
We run workshops so we have a central essential session on interviews.
54:52
It's basically this presentation, but we have a lab we get to work with other students worth checking out,
54:55
book one to one, appointments via jobs live. You can use those to discuss interviews.
55:00
You could even speak to our front desk, see if you get a mock interview booked up. Keep an eye out for our careers.
55:04
Fair are big ones coming up?
55:08
Are we actually got one more now coming up as it's the IT technology fair, probably the one specifically of interest to you guys.
55:10
That is on Thursday to twenty eight. It's online. I believe it opens a week before.
55:17
So you might be able to get in there now and start seeing the companies and make
55:21
bookings to speak with recruiters and ask them questions about their job roles,
55:24
their internships, their recruitment process. I am happy to stay on the line now and take any questions, so I will close off.
55:29
The recording I appreciate is two o'clock, so you may have lectures to go to.
55:35
I'm clearly wanting to promote one to one appointments because I put that in again next week.
55:40
We're going to look at those psychometric tests. There's a Q&A slide again.
55:44
There's our final closing slide. So I'm going to stop the recording.
55:49
If you do have questions and you're happy to stay on the call, please do reach out.
55:52
So recording will stop.
55:55
